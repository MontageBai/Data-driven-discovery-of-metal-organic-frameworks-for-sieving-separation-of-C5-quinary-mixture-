    "🧠 Thinking Steps and Judgment Criteria:\n",
    "1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size:\n",
    "From the experimental data, identify all adsorbed (Yes) and non-adsorbed (No due to size exclusion) guest molecules.\n",
    "For each such molecule, extract its intermediate dimension from its A×B×C format.\n",
    "Infer the MOF’s effective pore size as being:\n",
    "Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of the adsorbed molecules.\n",
    "Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of the non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion).\n",
    "If both types of data exist, define an inferred effective pore size range:\n",
    "Effective pore size ∈ [max_intermediate_adsorbed, min_intermediate_nonadsorbed)\n",
    "2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:\n",
    "Look up the full dimensions of each target guest molecule.\n",
    "Extract its intermediate dimension (the second largest value among A, B, C).\n",
    "3. Comprehensive Judgment:\n",
    "Compare the target molecule’s intermediate dimension with the MOF's inferred effective pore size or range:\n",
    "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed, → Can Adsorb\n",
    "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≥ min_intermediate_nonadsorbed, → Cannot Adsorb\n",
    "If within the inferred range, analyze trends and mention if kinetic sieving behavior has been observed for similar-sized molecules.\n",
    "4. Note Experimental Conditions:\n",
    "While pressure and temperature may affect diffusion or adsorption energy, this evaluation focuses purely on geometric compatibility based on the intermediate molecular dimension.\n",

    "- The target guest molecule’s full dimensions and its **intermediate dimension**.\n",

    "- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)\n",
