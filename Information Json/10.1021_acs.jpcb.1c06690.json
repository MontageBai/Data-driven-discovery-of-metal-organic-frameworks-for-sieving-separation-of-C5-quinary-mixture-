            "Additional Info": "Coordination nanocage formation is entropy-driven, influenced by the size and conformation entropy loss of macromolecular IPA ligands due to space crowding on the surface. The chemical equilibrium of formation can be tuned by the Cu2+/IPA ratio. Studied by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) for thermodynamics and Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) for monitoring size evolution during assembly."
