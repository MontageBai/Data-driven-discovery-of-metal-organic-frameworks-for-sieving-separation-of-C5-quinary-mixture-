The as-synthesized Azo-COF exhibits high surface area and high thermochemical stability (up to 418 °C). It was utilized by packing into a 100 μL Axygen pipette tip (Lab-in-Tip) for robust enrichment and size-exclusive analysis in complex biological samples. The TBPy building block is super hydrophobic, enhancing binding efficiency for desirable peptides."
