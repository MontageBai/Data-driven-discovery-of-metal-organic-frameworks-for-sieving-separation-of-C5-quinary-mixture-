Faster breakthrough compared to 1-butanol due to lower adsorption affinity."

            "Additional Info": "ZIF-8 possesses structural flexibility, allowing for a 0.5 Å increase in pore entrance at high pressures (>1.47 GPa) due to linker rotation, but this flexibility was found to have little influence on the adsorption equilibrium of alcohols in this study. Material prepared as pellets (250-500 µm) and studied for adsorptive recovery of alcohols from vapor phase."
