MOF Name: BSF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BSF-1:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BSF-1:
The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 3.200 Å (acetylene).
The smallest intermediate dimension of a non-adsorbed molecule (due to size exclusion) is 3.877 Å (methane).
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of BSF-1 is less than 3.877 Å, meaning it accommodates molecules with an intermediate dimension of approximately 3.200 Å but excludes those with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger. The effective pore size lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BSF-1.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: BSF-1
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BSF-1:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BSF-1:
The inferred effective pore size of BSF-1 is less than 3.877 Å, accommodating molecules with an intermediate dimension of approximately 3.200 Å but excluding those with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger. The effective pore size lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BSF-1.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BSF-1:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BSF-1:
The inferred effective pore size of BSF-1 is less than 3.877 Å, accommodating molecules with an intermediate dimension of approximately 3.200 Å but excluding those with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger. The effective pore size lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BSF-1.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BSF-1:
The inferred effective pore size of BSF-1 is less than 3.877 Å, accommodating molecules with an intermediate dimension of approximately 3.200 Å but excluding those with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger. The effective pore size lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BSF-1.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
