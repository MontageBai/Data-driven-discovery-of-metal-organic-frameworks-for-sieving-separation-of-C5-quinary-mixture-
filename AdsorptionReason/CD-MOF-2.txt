MOF Name: CD-MOF-2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CD-MOF-2:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Chemical adsorption via hydroxyl groups).
- No molecules are reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion".

Inferred effective pore size of CD-MOF-2:
Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide, the effective pore size of CD-MOF-2 is at least 3.200 Å. However, since no molecules are reported as being excluded due to size, an upper limit for the pore size cannot be determined from the provided experimental data using the size exclusion principle.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by CD-MOF-2 in the provided data. Without experimental data indicating the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, or an upper pore size limit derived from non-adsorption data (due to size exclusion), it is not possible to confirm that CD-MOF-2 can adsorb isoprene based solely on the provided information and the size exclusion principle. Therefore, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb" as its adsorption cannot be confirmed by the given data.
