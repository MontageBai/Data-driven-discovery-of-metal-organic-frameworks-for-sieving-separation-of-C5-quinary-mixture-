MOF Name: [BMI]2[Ca3(H2TCPP)2(μ2-OH2)2(H2O)2]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [BMI]2[Ca3(H2TCPP)2(μ2-OH2)2(H2O)2]:
- Oxygen (O2): 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = **2.860 Å** | Adsorbed
The stated reason for oxygen adsorption is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," and the Adsorption Type is "Facilitated diffusion through mesoporous channels."

Inferred effective pore size of the MOF:
The MOF is reported to adsorb oxygen (intermediate dimension of 2.860 Å), with the adsorption described as occurring due to "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". This suggests that while oxygen can pass, the effective pore apertures are in the sub-nanometer range and are sufficiently size-selective such that larger molecules within this scale might be excluded. Although "mesoporous channels" are mentioned, this could refer to a larger overall channel structure while the critical pore 'windows' or bottlenecks are still sub-nanometer and govern selective passage. Therefore, we infer that the critical effective pore size is in the vicinity of 2.860 Å, making it a tight fit for oxygen and potentially excluding molecules significantly larger than oxygen due to size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than oxygen's intermediate dimension (2.860 Å) which is known to be adsorbed under "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" conditions. Given that the MOF's critical pore apertures are likely in the immediate vicinity of oxygen's size (around 2.860 Å) for size exclusion to be a primary mechanism, isoprene is too large to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than oxygen's intermediate dimension (2.860 Å) which is known to be adsorbed under "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" conditions. Given that the MOF's critical pore apertures are likely in the immediate vicinity of oxygen's size (around 2.860 Å) for size exclusion to be a primary mechanism, cis-2-pentene is too large to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Given that the MOF's critical pore apertures are likely in the immediate vicinity of oxygen's size (around 2.860 Å) for size exclusion to be a primary mechanism, 1-pentene is too large to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.
