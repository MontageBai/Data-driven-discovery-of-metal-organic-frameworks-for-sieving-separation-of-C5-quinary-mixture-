MOF Name: FDC-0a
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FDC-0a:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorption is "Temperature-dependent" via "Kinetic sieving" at 180 K.

Inferred effective pore size of FDC-0a at 180 K is approximately 2.860 Å or slightly larger, allowing oxygen to pass with kinetic hindrance. The material is noted to be "Temperature-responsive" with "pore-aperture contraction and expansion". The target conditions for prediction are 298 K, which is different from the experimental 180 K. While the pore size might change with temperature, a pore that exhibits kinetic sieving for oxygen at 180 K suggests a relatively tight fit.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is substantially larger than the inferred effective pore size of FDC-0a at 180 K (~2.860 Å). Despite the temperature-responsive nature of FDC-0a, it is highly improbable that its pore aperture would expand sufficiently from 180 K to 298 K to accommodate a molecule more than twice the intermediate size of oxygen. Therefore, based on size exclusion, isoprene is predicted to be non-adsorbed under standard conditions.
