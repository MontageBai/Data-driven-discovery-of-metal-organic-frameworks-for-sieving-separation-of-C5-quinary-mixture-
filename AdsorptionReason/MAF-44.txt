MOF Name: MAF-44
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Molecular sieving via pore-opening flexibility, Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-44 is *less than* 6.393 Å, as isobutane is excluded due to size exclusion. This implies that the MOF's pores are not large enough to accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å or larger.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the smallest known excluded molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it is geometrically possible for isoprene to pass through the pores of MAF-44 and therefore be adsorbed. While the exact lower bound of the pore size cannot be precisely determined from the single provided 'Not Adsorbed' data point, the principle of size exclusion suggests that molecules smaller than the excluded one *can* be adsorbed unless further experimental data indicates otherwise.

MOF Name: MAF-44
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Molecular sieving via pore-opening flexibility, Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-44 is *less than* 6.393 Å, as isobutane is excluded due to size exclusion. This implies that the MOF's pores are not large enough to accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å or larger.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the smallest known excluded molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it is geometrically possible for cis-2-pentene to pass through the pores of MAF-44 and therefore be adsorbed. While the exact lower bound of the pore size cannot be precisely determined from the single provided 'Not Adsorbed' data point, the principle of size exclusion suggests that molecules smaller than the excluded one *can* be adsorbed unless further experimental data indicates otherwise.

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Molecular sieving via pore-opening flexibility, Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-44 is *less than* 6.393 Å, as isobutane is excluded due to size exclusion. This implies that the MOF's pores are not large enough to accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å or larger.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the smallest known excluded molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it is geometrically possible for 1-pentene to pass through the pores of MAF-44 and therefore be adsorbed. While the exact lower bound of the pore size cannot be precisely determined from the single provided 'Not Adsorbed' data point, the principle of size exclusion suggests that molecules smaller than the excluded one *can* be adsorbed unless further experimental data indicates otherwise.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Molecular sieving via pore-opening flexibility, Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the smallest known excluded molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it is geometrically possible for trans-2-pentene to pass through the pores of MAF-44 and therefore be adsorbed. While the exact lower bound of the pore size cannot be precisely determined from the single provided 'Not Adsorbed' data point, the principle of size exclusion suggests that molecules smaller than the excluded one *can* be adsorbed unless further experimental data indicates otherwise.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the smallest known excluded molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it is geometrically possible for n-pentane to pass through the pores of MAF-44 and therefore be adsorbed.
