MOF Name: ZU-36-Ni
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Ni:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Ni allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 5.151 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.310 Å or larger. This suggests the effective pore size is within the range [5.151 Å, 5.310 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the smallest intermediate dimension of a non-adsorbed molecule (5.310 Å for cis-2-butene) by ZU-36-Ni, it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Ni
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Ni:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Ni allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 5.151 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.310 Å or larger. This suggests the effective pore size is within the range [5.151 Å, 5.310 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the smallest intermediate dimension of a non-adsorbed molecule (5.310 Å for cis-2-butene) by ZU-36-Ni, it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Ni
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Ni:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Ni allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 5.151 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.310 Å or larger. This suggests the effective pore size is within the range [5.151 Å, 5.310 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (5.151 Å for trans-2-butene) by ZU-36-Ni, it can be adsorbed.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (5.151 Å for trans-2-butene) by ZU-36-Ni, it can be adsorbed.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (5.151 Å for trans-2-butene) by ZU-36-Ni, it can be adsorbed.
