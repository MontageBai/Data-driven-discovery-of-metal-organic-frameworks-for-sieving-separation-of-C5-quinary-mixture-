MOF Name: SIFSIX-Cu-TPA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Diffusional restriction combined with specific host-guest interactions, size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
Since isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) was explicitly stated as "Not Adsorbed" due to "size exclusion," this indicates that the effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA is strictly **less than 6.393 Å**.
There is no experimental data provided for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA showing any molecule being adsorbed, which means we cannot infer a lower bound for the effective pore size from the given data. Thus, the inferred effective pore size is < 6.393 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension is 6.093 Å. While this is slightly smaller than isobutane's intermediate dimension (6.393 Å), we know the MOF's effective pore size is less than 6.393 Å. Without any data indicating that molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.093 Å or smaller *can* be adsorbed by SIFSIX-Cu-TPA, and given the observed size exclusion for a molecule of very similar size, it cannot be confirmed that isoprene can pass through the pores. Therefore, based on the provided limited data and the principle that adsorption must be confirmed rather than assumed, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

MOF Name: SIFSIX-Cu-TPA
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Diffusional restriction combined with specific host-guest interactions, size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
The effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA is strictly **less than 6.393 Å**. There is no experimental data provided to establish a lower bound for the effective pore size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension is 5.572 Å. While smaller than isobutane's intermediate dimension (6.393 Å), the MOF's effective pore size is only known to be less than 6.393 Å. Without any data confirming the adsorption of molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.572 Å or smaller for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA, adsorption cannot be definitively predicted. Given the size exclusion observed for a slightly larger molecule, the most conservative prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

MOF Name: SIFSIX-Cu-TPA
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Diffusional restriction combined with specific host-guest interactions, size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
The effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA is strictly **less than 6.393 Å**. There is no experimental data provided to establish a lower bound for the effective pore size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension is 4.995 Å. This is smaller than isobutane's intermediate dimension (6.393 Å). However, the MOF's effective pore size is only known to be less than 6.393 Å. Without any data confirming the adsorption of molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.995 Å or smaller for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA, adsorption cannot be definitively predicted. Given the size exclusion observed for a larger molecule, the most conservative prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

MOF Name: SIFSIX-Cu-TPA
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Diffusional restriction combined with specific host-guest interactions, size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:
The effective pore size of SIFSIX-Cu-TPA is strictly **less than 6.393 Å**. There is no experimental data provided to establish a lower bound for the effective pore size.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension is 4.733 Å. This is smaller than isobutane's intermediate dimension (6.393 Å). However, the MOF's effective pore size is only known to be less than 6.393 Å. Without any data confirming the adsorption of molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.733 Å or smaller for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA, adsorption cannot be definitively predicted. Given the size exclusion observed for a larger molecule, the most conservative prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA:

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension is 4.364 Å. This is smaller than isobutane's intermediate dimension (6.393 Å). However, the MOF's effective pore size is only known to be less than 6.393 Å. Without any data confirming the adsorption of molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.364 Å or smaller for SIFSIX-Cu-TPA, adsorption cannot be definitively predicted. Given the size exclusion observed for a larger molecule, the most conservative prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".
