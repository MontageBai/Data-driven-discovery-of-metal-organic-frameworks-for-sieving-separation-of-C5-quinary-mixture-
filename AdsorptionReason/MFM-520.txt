MOF Name: MFM-520
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MFM-520:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic driving separation)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic driving separation)

Inferred effective pore size of MFM-520:
The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 5.051 Å (propylene). Therefore, the MOF's effective pore size is inferred to be at least 5.051 Å.
No molecules are reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. Thus, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be established from the provided data. The inferred effective pore size is >= 5.051 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest experimentally adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å). However, without data on molecules that are excluded by size, we cannot establish an upper limit for MFM-520's pore size. Therefore, based solely on the provided data, we cannot rule out adsorption due to size exclusion. It is predicted that isoprene can adsorb, assuming its kinetic diameter allows passage. The "Kinetic driving separation" observed for propylene suggests that the pore might be a tight fit for molecules around this size, potentially affecting diffusion rates.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å), it is expected to be adsorbed by MFM-520. The "Kinetic driving separation" observed for propylene suggests that the pore might be a tight fit for molecules around this size, potentially affecting diffusion rates.
