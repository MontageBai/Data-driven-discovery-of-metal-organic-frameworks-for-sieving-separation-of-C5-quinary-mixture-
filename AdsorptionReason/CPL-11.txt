MOF Name: CPL-11
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Xenon: 4.320×4.320×4.320 → Intermediate = 4.320 Å | Adsorbed
(Note: Oxygen adsorption is stated as "Temperature-dependent" and does not provide a clear size exclusion boundary under general conditions (298 K, 1 bar), thus it is not used to infer the primary pore size limit.)

Based on the largest intermediate dimension of molecules experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by CPL-11 (Xenon, 4.320 Å), the inferred effective pore size of CPL-11 is at least 4.320 Å. There is no experimental data for molecules failing to adsorb due to size exclusion to establish an explicit upper limit for the pore size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by CPL-11 (Xenon, 4.320 Å), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by CPL-11 due to size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by CPL-11 (Xenon, 4.320 Å), it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by CPL-11 due to size exclusion.
