**MOF Name: Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco)**

**Inferred Effective Pore Size for Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco):**

From the experimental data:
*   **Carbon dioxide (CO2)**: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = **3.200 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **Methane (CH4)**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Not Adsorbed (No)

Based on these data, the MOF Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco) can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å (CO2) but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (CH4). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco) lies in the range **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.

**MOF Name: Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco)**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF’s inferred effective pore size is in the range **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn2(BDC)2(Dabco).
