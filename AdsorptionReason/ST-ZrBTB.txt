Here is the evaluation for ST-ZrBTB based on the provided data:

MOF Name: ST-ZrBTB
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ST-ZrBTB:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ST-ZrBTB:
Based on the adsorbed molecules, the pore size must be at least 3.877 Å (the intermediate dimension of methane, the largest adsorbed molecule reported).
There are no reported molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so an explicit upper bound for the pore size cannot be strictly determined from the given data. However, the reported mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," implying that the pore size is precisely tuned and sensitive to small differences in molecular dimensions.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule (methane, 3.877 Å), with a difference of approximately 2.216 Å. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, such a substantial difference in size strongly indicates that isoprene would be too large to pass through the MOF's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: ST-ZrBTB
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ST-ZrBTB:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ST-ZrBTB:
The pore size must be at least 3.877 Å. The mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale."

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the largest experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule (methane, 3.877 Å), with a difference of approximately 1.695 Å. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, this difference strongly suggests that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: ST-ZrBTB
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ST-ZrBTB:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ST-ZrBTB:
The pore size must be at least 3.877 Å. The mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale."

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the largest experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule (methane, 3.877 Å), with a difference of approximately 1.118 Å. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, this difference strongly suggests that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: ST-ZrBTB
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ST-ZrBTB:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ST-ZrBTB:
The pore size must be at least 3.877 Å. The mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale."

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the largest experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule (methane, 3.877 Å), with a difference of approximately 0.856 Å. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, this difference strongly suggests that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: ST-ZrBTB
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ST-ZrBTB:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ST-ZrBTB:
The pore size must be at least 3.877 Å. The mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale."

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than the largest experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule (methane, 3.877 Å), with a difference of approximately 0.487 Å. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, even this difference is significant enough to cause size exclusion in sub-nanometer pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
