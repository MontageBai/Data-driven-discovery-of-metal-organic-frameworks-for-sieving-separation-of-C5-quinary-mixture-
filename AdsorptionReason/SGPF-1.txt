Here's the analysis for SGPF-1 and the target guest molecules based on the provided data:

**Thinking Steps:**

1.  **Extract Known Adsorption Data for SGPF-1 and their Intermediate Dimensions:**
    *   **Acetylene:** 5.538×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å (Adsorbed: Yes)
    *   **Carbon dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å (Adsorbed: Yes)
    *   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å (Adsorbed: Yes)

2.  **Infer SGPF-1's Effective Pore Size:**
    *   From the experimental data, the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule observed to be adsorbed by SGPF-1 is 4.047 Å (ethylene).
    *   No molecules are listed as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. This means we only have a lower bound for the pore size. The effective pore size of SGPF-1 is experimentally demonstrated to be at least 4.047 Å.
    *   In the absence of data explicitly showing adsorption of molecules larger than 4.047 Å, or non-adsorption of molecules that would define an upper limit, it is inferred that the material's effective pore size is around this maximum observed adsorption dimension. Molecules with significantly larger dimensions are generally expected to be excluded by size.

3.  **Identify Target Guest Molecules and their Intermediate Dimensions:**
    *   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
    *   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
    *   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
    *   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
    *   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

4.  **Compare and Predict:**
    All target molecules have intermediate dimensions (ranging from 4.364 Å to 6.093 Å) that are larger than the maximum intermediate dimension of molecules explicitly shown to be adsorbed by SGPF-1 (4.047 Å). Based on the principle of size exclusion, and without any experimental data demonstrating that SGPF-1 can adsorb molecules larger than 4.047 Å, it is predicted that these larger molecules will not be adsorbed due to exceeding the effective pore size.

**Predictions:**

MOF Name: SGPF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF SGPF-1 has demonstrated adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 4.047 Å. There is no experimental data provided indicating that SGPF-1 can adsorb molecules larger than this, nor is there data on molecules explicitly rejected by size exclusion.
Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule observed to be adsorbed (4.047 Å), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by SGPF-1 due to size exclusion.
