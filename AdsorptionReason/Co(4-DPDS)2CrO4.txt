**MOF Name: Co(4-DPDS)2CrO4**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Co(4-DPDS)2CrO4 at 298 K, 1 bar:
-   **Acetylene**: 5.538×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes). The mechanism involves a "Gate-opening effect".
-   **Ethylene**: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (No). The reason given is "Size exclusion due to smaller pore size after activation". This indicates that the effective pore aperture for size exclusion is less than 4.047 Å under these conditions.
-   **Carbon dioxide**: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (No). The reason is "Electrostatic repulsion", which is not a size-exclusion mechanism, so this data point is not used to infer pore size based on physical dimension.

Based on the size exclusion data:
The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (acetylene) to be adsorbed (albeit with a gate-opening effect).
The MOF prevents molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) from being adsorbed due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2CrO4 is approximately between 3.200 Å and less than 4.047 Å for size exclusion to occur at 298 K, 1 bar. More specifically, it suggests that the pore is effectively smaller than 4.047 Å.

**Isoprene Dimensions:**
-   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

**Conclusion:**
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper limit inferred from size exclusion for ethylene (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Co(4-DPDS)2CrO4 under these conditions.
