MOF Name: Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4

**Detailed Reasoning for Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4's Pore Size:**
From the experimental data for Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4:
*   **Acetylene:** 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å. Adsorbed (Yes), primarily due to a "Gate-opening effect". This indicates that the MOF can accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å after activation/gate-opening.
*   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å. Not Adsorbed (No), explicitly stated as "Size exclusion due to smaller pore size after activation". This is the critical piece of information. It means that even after any potential gate-opening or activation, the effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 is *smaller* than 4.047 Å.
*   **Carbon Dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å. Not Adsorbed (No), but the reason is "Electrostatic repulsion", not size exclusion. Thus, this data point does not define the pore size limit.

Based on `acetylene` adsorption (3.200 Å) and `ethylene` non-adsorption due to size exclusion (4.047 Å), the inferred experimental effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 lies in the range of **[3.200 Å, 4.047 Å)**. This means it can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to, but not including, 4.047 Å.

MOF Name: Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The inferred effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 is [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the MOF's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The inferred effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 is [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the MOF's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 due to size exclusion.

Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The inferred effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 is [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the MOF's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 due to size exclusion.

*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the MOF's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Co(4-DPDS)2MoO4 due to size exclusion.
