MOF Name: NbOFFIVE-14-Co-i
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbOFFIVE-14-Co-i:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbOFFIVE-14-Co-i lies between **4.047 Å and 4.175 Å**, i.e., it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension less than 4.175 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by NbOFFIVE-14-Co-i due to size exclusion.
