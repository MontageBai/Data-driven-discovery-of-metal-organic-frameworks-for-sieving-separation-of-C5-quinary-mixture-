MOF Name: JNU-80-NP
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for JNU-80-NP:
- 2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion)
- Hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, also due to size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of JNU-80-NP:
Based on the explicit "Yes" for 2-methylpentane (intermediate dimension 6.376 Å) and "No" for 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) due to size exclusion, the effective pore size of JNU-80-NP lies in the range of **6.376 Å ≤ Pore Size < 6.545 Å**. The "Conditional" adsorption of hexane (4.607 Å) further supports that the pore is open to molecules of at least this size, but the tightest bounds for the aperture are defined by 2-methylpentane and 2,2-dimethylbutane.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.376 Å for a "Yes" adsorption), it is predicted to be easily adsorbed by JNU-80-NP.
