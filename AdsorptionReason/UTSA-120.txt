MOF Name: UTSA-120
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Mechanism: Chemical adsorption via tetrazine and SiF62- pillars)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-120:
The only provided data point for UTSA-120 indicates adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). While this confirms that the MOF's pores are at least 3.200 Å, the reported mechanism is "Chemical adsorption", not "Size exclusion". This means the adsorption is driven by specific chemical interactions rather than purely geometric fit. Critically, there is no experimental data indicating which molecules are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, we cannot establish an upper bound for the MOF’s effective pore size based on size exclusion, as defined in the problem's criteria.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by UTSA-120. In the absence of any data showing the adsorption of larger molecules, or a defined upper limit for size exclusion, it is a conservative and reasonable scientific prediction that a molecule more than twice the size of the only known adsorbed molecule (especially when its adsorption is chemically driven rather than purely size-based) would likely be excluded. Therefore, based on the available limited data, UTSA-120 is predicted to **Cannot Adsorb** isoprene.

MOF Name: UTSA-120
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Mechanism: Chemical adsorption via tetrazine and SiF62- pillars)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-120:
As detailed above, the adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) by UTSA-120 is reported to be via "Chemical adsorption". There is no experimental data for molecules *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which prevents the inference of an upper bound for the MOF’s effective pore size based on size exclusion. Thus, we only know the pore is at least 3.200 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence suggesting UTSA-120's ability to adsorb molecules of this size, and considering that the only confirmed adsorption is for a much smaller molecule via a chemical mechanism, it is predicted that UTSA-120 **Cannot Adsorb** cis-2-pentene.

MOF Name: UTSA-120
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Mechanism: Chemical adsorption via tetrazine and SiF62- pillars)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-120:
The only provided data indicates that carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed by UTSA-120, and the mechanism is "Chemical adsorption". No data on molecules excluded by size is provided, meaning an upper limit for the MOF’s effective pore size based on size exclusion cannot be determined from the given information.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is substantially larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). Given the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules of this size, and the chemical nature of the only known adsorption, it is predicted that UTSA-120 **Cannot Adsorb** 1-pentene.

MOF Name: UTSA-120
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Mechanism: Chemical adsorption via tetrazine and SiF62- pillars)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-120:
Based on the single experimental data point, UTSA-120 adsorbs carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) via a "Chemical adsorption" mechanism. The absence of data on molecules excluded by size means that a definitive upper bound for the MOF's effective pore size (based on size exclusion) cannot be established from the provided information.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is notably larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence to suggest that UTSA-120 can accommodate molecules of this size, and considering the specific chemical adsorption of the only confirmed guest, it is predicted that UTSA-120 **Cannot Adsorb** trans-2-pentene.

MOF Name: UTSA-120
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Mechanism: Chemical adsorption via tetrazine and SiF62- pillars)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-120:
The available experimental data for UTSA-120 shows adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) via "Chemical adsorption". There is no data indicating which molecules are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, making it impossible to infer an upper limit for the MOF’s effective pore size based on size exclusion. The pore is known to be at least 3.200 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of n-pentane (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). Given the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of larger molecules by UTSA-120, and the specific chemical nature of the only confirmed adsorption, it is predicted that UTSA-120 **Cannot Adsorb** n-pentane.
