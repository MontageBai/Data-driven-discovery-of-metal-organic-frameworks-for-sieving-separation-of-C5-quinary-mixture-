MOF Name: Ca(sdb)

**Detailed Reasoning for Ca(sdb) pore characteristics:**
From the provided experimental data for Ca(sdb):
*   **Adsorbed (Yes):**
    *   **ethane:** 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = **4.175 Å**
    *   **propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = **4.354 Å**
    *   **butane:** 7.709×4.532×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.532 Å**
*   **Not Adsorbed (No) due to Size Exclusion:**
    *   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

**Inference of Ca(sdb)'s Effective Pore Size and Mechanism:**
A direct, consistent range for Ca(sdb)'s effective pore size based *solely* on the intermediate dimension cannot be strictly inferred from the provided data. While butane (intermediate 4.532 Å) is successfully adsorbed, n-pentane (intermediate 4.364 Å), which has a *smaller* intermediate dimension, is reported as *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. This is a contradiction if intermediate dimension is the *only* decisive factor for simple size exclusion.

This anomaly suggests that for Ca(sdb), particularly with linear alkanes, factors beyond just the intermediate dimension, such as molecular length (n-pentane is longer than butane) or specific shape/orientation within the pore, are critical for adsorption or exclusion. This behavior, where molecules of seemingly appropriate size are excluded, is indicative of a "kinetic sieving" effect or a more complex size exclusion mechanism based on multiple molecular dimensions or molecular flexibility, even though the experimental data labels it broadly as "Size exclusion."

For the purpose of prediction, we must consider the following:
1.  The largest intermediate dimension successfully adsorbed is that of butane (**4.532 Å**). Therefore, molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 4.532 Å are highly unlikely to be adsorbed.
2.  n-pentane (intermediate **4.364 Å**) is explicitly shown to be *not* adsorbed. This sets a specific exclusion point for that particular molecule, despite its intermediate dimension being smaller than butane's.

Therefore, the pore of Ca(sdb) can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 4.532 Å, but has a specific exclusion for n-pentane and likely similar elongated molecules even if their intermediate dimension is smaller.

**Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: Ca(sdb)**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   Conclusion: The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of butane (4.532 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Ca(sdb). Therefore, based on size exclusion, isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Ca(sdb)**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
*   Conclusion: The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of butane (4.532 Å), the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed. Therefore, based on size exclusion, cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Ca(sdb)**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
*   Conclusion: The intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of butane (4.532 Å), the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed. Given that n-pentane (4.364 Å intermediate) is already excluded, it is highly unlikely that a molecule with an even larger intermediate dimension than butane would be adsorbed. Therefore, based on size exclusion, 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Ca(sdb)**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
*   Conclusion: The intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of butane (4.532 Å), the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed. Therefore, based on size exclusion, trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Ca(sdb)**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**
*   Conclusion: The provided experimental data explicitly states that n-pentane is **Not Adsorbed** by Ca(sdb) due to size exclusion. Therefore, based on the experimental data, n-pentane cannot be adsorbed.
