MOF Name: MET-Fe
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MET-Fe:
*   **trans-2-butene**: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.151 Å** | Adsorbed
*   **cis-2-butene**: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.310 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe is determined by these observations. It allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.151 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.310 Å. Thus, the inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe lies in the range **[5.151 Å, 5.310 Å)**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.310 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MET-Fe due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: MET-Fe
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MET-Fe:
*   **trans-2-butene**: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.151 Å** | Adsorbed
*   **cis-2-butene**: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.310 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe lies in the range **[5.151 Å, 5.310 Å)**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.310 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MET-Fe due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: MET-Fe
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MET-Fe:
*   **trans-2-butene**: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.151 Å** | Adsorbed
*   **cis-2-butene**: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.310 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe lies in the range **[5.151 Å, 5.310 Å)**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.151 Å), it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. The experimental data shows that trans-2-butene (intermediate dimension 5.151 Å) is adsorbed, and 1-pentene is smaller than this. Therefore, it can be adsorbed by MET-Fe.

MOF Name: MET-Fe
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MET-Fe:
*   **trans-2-butene**: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.151 Å** | Adsorbed
*   **cis-2-butene**: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.310 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe lies in the range **[5.151 Å, 5.310 Å)**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.151 Å), it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. The experimental data shows that trans-2-butene (intermediate dimension 5.151 Å) is adsorbed, and trans-2-pentene is smaller than this. Therefore, it can be adsorbed by MET-Fe.

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MET-Fe:
*   **trans-2-butene**: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.151 Å** | Adsorbed
*   **cis-2-butene**: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.310 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MET-Fe lies in the range **[5.151 Å, 5.310 Å)**.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.151 Å), it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. The experimental data shows that trans-2-butene (intermediate dimension 5.151 Å) is adsorbed, and n-pentane is smaller than this. Therefore, it can be adsorbed by MET-Fe.
