MOF Name: DAT-MOF-1

Detailed Reasoning for DAT-MOF-1:
From experimental data:
*   Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed
*   Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of DAT-MOF-1 lies between **6.762 Å and 6.949 Å**, allowing molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 6.762 Å to pass, but preventing molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.949 Å. This indicates a very narrow pore aperture with a precise size exclusion mechanism.

MOF Name: DAT-MOF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, it is predicted to be adsorbed by DAT-MOF-1.

MOF Name: DAT-MOF-1
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, it is predicted to be adsorbed by DAT-MOF-1.

MOF Name: DAT-MOF-1
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, it is predicted to be adsorbed by DAT-MOF-1.

Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, it is predicted to be adsorbed by DAT-MOF-1.

Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, it is predicted to be adsorbed by DAT-MOF-1.
