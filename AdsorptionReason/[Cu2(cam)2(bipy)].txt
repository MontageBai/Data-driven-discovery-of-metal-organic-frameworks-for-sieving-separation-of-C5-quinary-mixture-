MOF Name: [Cu2(cam)2(bipy)]

Detailed Reasoning for all guest molecules:
From the provided experimental adsorption data for [Cu2(cam)2(bipy)], the following molecules were successfully adsorbed ("Yes"):

*   **Methane**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate dimension = 3.877 Å
*   **Ethane**: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate dimension = 4.175 Å
*   **Propane**: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate dimension = 4.354 Å
*   **Isobutane**: 6.404×6.393×4.866 Å → Intermediate dimension = 6.393 Å
*   **Cyclohexane**: 6.949×7.090×4.855 Å → Intermediate dimension = 6.949 Å
*   **3,3-dimethylpentane**: 7.269×6.397×5.724 Å → Intermediate dimension = 6.397 Å

The largest intermediate dimension among all the molecules confirmed to be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(bipy)] is 6.949 Å (for Cyclohexane).
Based on the size exclusion principle, this indicates that the effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(bipy)] is at least 6.949 Å. Since there are no "No" adsorption cases reported due to size exclusion, we do not have an established upper bound for the pore size. Therefore, our inference is that the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to and including 6.949 Å, and potentially larger.

We will now evaluate each target guest molecule by comparing its intermediate dimension to this inferred lower bound. If the target molecule's intermediate dimension is less than or equal to 6.949 Å, it is predicted to be adsorbable. No kinetic sieving phenomena were observed for similar molecules in the provided data to suggest a tighter fit or selective non-adsorption for molecules of comparable size.

Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate dimension = 6.093 Å
Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of known adsorbed molecules (6.949 Å), it is predicted that isoprene can be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(bipy)] based on the size exclusion principle.
