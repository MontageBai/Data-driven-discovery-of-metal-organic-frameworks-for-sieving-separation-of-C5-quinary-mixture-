MOF Name: JNU-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of JNU-1:
The MOF is known to adsorb acetylene, implying an effective pore size of at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for any guest molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, an upper limit for the effective pore size of JNU-1 cannot be inferred from the given information based on the size exclusion principle. The inferred pore size range is `[3.200 Å, ∞)`.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than that of acetylene (3.200 Å). While it does not fall under the rule "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed," there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for JNU-1. Specifically, no molecule is listed as "No" due to size exclusion. Therefore, it is not possible to apply the rule "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≥ min_intermediate_nonadsorbed" to conclude non-adsorption. Based strictly on the provided data and the absence of any information suggesting size exclusion for molecules larger than acetylene, we cannot definitively conclude that isoprene *cannot* be adsorbed. Given the requirement for a binary prediction, and without evidence of exclusion, the prediction is "Can Adsorb".
