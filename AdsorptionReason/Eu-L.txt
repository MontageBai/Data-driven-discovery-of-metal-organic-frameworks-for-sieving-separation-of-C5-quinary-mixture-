MOF Name: Eu-L
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Eu-L:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale."

Inferred effective pore size of Eu-L:
The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) suggests that the effective pore size of Eu-L is at least 3.200 Å. The mechanism "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" implies that the pores are in the sub-nanometer range, and that even for a small molecule like CO2, its size is a critical factor for passage. This strongly suggests that the pore size is not significantly larger than 3.200 Å. Without experimental data for a molecule that was *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, a precise upper bound cannot be established. However, the mention of "size exclusion" for CO2 points to a tight pore.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is noted to adsorb via a "size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism. Given this tight fit for CO2, it is highly probable that the much larger isoprene molecule cannot pass through the sub-nanometer pores of Eu-L.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
