MOF Name: Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 is **less than 3.200 Å**, as carbon monoxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot pass due to size exclusion. No "Adsorbed" data is provided for this MOF to establish a lower bound.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is < 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 is **less than 3.200 Å**, as carbon monoxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot pass due to size exclusion. No "Adsorbed" data is provided for this MOF to establish a lower bound.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is < 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 is **less than 3.200 Å**, as carbon monoxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot pass due to size exclusion. No "Adsorbed" data is provided for this MOF to establish a lower bound.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is < 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 due to size exclusion.

Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 is **less than 3.200 Å**, as carbon monoxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot pass due to size exclusion. No "Adsorbed" data is provided for this MOF to establish a lower bound.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is < 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 due to size exclusion.

Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 is **less than 3.200 Å**, as carbon monoxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot pass due to size exclusion. No "Adsorbed" data is provided for this MOF to establish a lower bound.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is < 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu(FMA)(4,4'-Bipy)0.5 due to size exclusion.
