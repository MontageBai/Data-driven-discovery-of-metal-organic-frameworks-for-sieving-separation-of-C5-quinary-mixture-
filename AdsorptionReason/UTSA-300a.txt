MOF Name: UTSA-300a
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-300a:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-300a lies between **3.200 Å and 4.047 Å**, i.e., it allows molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ ~3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimension ≥ ~4.047 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-300a due to size exclusion. The experimental data also notes "Selective gate opening by acetylene" which implies a specific interaction for smaller molecules, but for larger molecules, the general size exclusion applies.
