MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200 Å): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 Å): Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of the MOF lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**. Specifically, the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. This sets the effective aperture just below 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the MOF's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200 Å): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 Å): Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of the MOF lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**. Specifically, the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. This sets the effective aperture just below 3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the MOF's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200 Å): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 Å): Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of the MOF lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**. Specifically, the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. This sets the effective aperture just below 3.877 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the MOF's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Y-fum-fcu-MOF and Eu-naph-fcu-MOF:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200 Å): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 Å): Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of the MOF lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**. Specifically, the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. This sets the effective aperture just below 3.877 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the MOF's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the MOF's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.
