MOF Name: ClO4-BTR
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ClO4-BTR:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed via Temperature-dependent, Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups (ClO4-) at 273 K, 100 kPa.
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed via Temperature-dependent, Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups (ClO4-) at 298 K, 100 kPa.

The MOF ClO4-BTR exhibits a "gate-opening" mechanism, meaning its pores are not rigidly fixed but can dynamically adjust (temporarily deviate) to allow gas admission. The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed under experimental conditions (including 298 K, 1 bar equivalent for methane) is 3.877 Å (methane).

There is no experimental data provided where a molecule was *not* adsorbed due to "size exclusion" for ClO4-BTR. Therefore, a strict upper bound for its effective pore size based on rigid size exclusion cannot be precisely inferred from the given data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (methane, 3.877 Å) by ClO4-BTR, even considering its gate-opening mechanism. While gate-opening allows for dynamic pore adjustment, there are physical limits to how much a pore can expand. Without experimental evidence of ClO4-BTR adsorbing molecules in this larger size range, it is inferred that isoprene is too large to be accommodated, even via temporary deviation of the gate-keeping groups, under the given conditions.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (methane, 3.877 Å) by ClO4-BTR, even considering its gate-opening mechanism. While gate-opening allows for dynamic pore adjustment, there are physical limits to how much a pore can expand. Without experimental evidence of ClO4-BTR adsorbing molecules in this larger size range, it is inferred that cis-2-pentene is too large to be accommodated, even via temporary deviation of the gate-keeping groups, under the given conditions.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
