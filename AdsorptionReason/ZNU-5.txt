MOF Name: ZNU-5
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZNU-5:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZNU-5:
ZNU-5 exhibits "Gate opening based molecular sieving". While acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed, carbon dioxide (also intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. This indicates a very high degree of selectivity, likely due to subtle shape differences or kinetic barriers at this pore size, rather than a simple numerical cut-off for the intermediate dimension alone. Crucially, molecules with intermediate dimensions of 3.877 Å (Methane) and 4.047 Å (Ethylene) are also explicitly *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. This establishes a practical upper limit for general adsorption by ZNU-5.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of molecules that ZNU-5 has been shown to exclude due to size (CO2 at 3.200 Å, Methane at 3.877 Å, and Ethylene at 4.047 Å). Given the material's highly selective nature even for molecules of similar intermediate dimensions, it is highly improbable that ZNU-5 can adsorb a molecule as large as isoprene.
