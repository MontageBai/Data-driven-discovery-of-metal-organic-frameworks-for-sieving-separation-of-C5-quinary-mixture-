MOF Name: MFU-4

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of MFU-4:**

From the experimental data provided for MFU-4:
*   **Carbon Dioxide:** Dimensions: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å. Intermediate dimension: **3.200 Å**. **Adsorbed.**
*   **Acetylene:** Dimensions: 5.538×3.200×3.200 Å. Intermediate dimension: **3.200 Å**. **NOT Adsorbed.** Reason: "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, Kinetic sieving."

This data indicates a highly precise pore size for MFU-4. While Carbon Dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) can pass, Acetylene (also intermediate 3.200 Å) cannot, due to a combination of size exclusion and kinetic sieving. This implies that the effective pore size is extremely close to 3.200 Å, and subtle differences in molecular shape or flexibility lead to strong kinetic sieving effects at this critical dimension.

Therefore, we can infer that any molecule with an intermediate dimension significantly *greater* than 3.200 Å will be effectively excluded by MFU-4 due to size exclusion. Even molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å face potential exclusion if their specific shape or interaction with the pore is unfavorable (as seen with acetylene).

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: MFU-4**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF MFU-4 has an inferred effective pore size that is highly selective around 3.200 Å, blocking acetylene (intermediate 3.200 Å) while allowing carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å). This indicates an extremely tight pore opening where even minor increases in molecular size or unfavorable shapes beyond this threshold lead to exclusion.
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å. Intermediate dimension: **6.093 Å**.
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size inferred from the experimental data (around 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MFU-4.

**MOF Name: MFU-4**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF MFU-4 has an inferred effective pore size that is highly selective around 3.200 Å, blocking acetylene (intermediate 3.200 Å) while allowing carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å). This indicates an extremely tight pore opening where even minor increases in molecular size or unfavorable shapes beyond this threshold lead to exclusion.
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å. Intermediate dimension: **5.572 Å**.
*   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size inferred from the experimental data (around 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MFU-4.

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF MFU-4 has an inferred effective pore size that is highly selective around 3.200 Å, blocking acetylene (intermediate 3.200 Å) while allowing carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å). This indicates an extremely tight pore opening where even minor increases in molecular size or unfavorable shapes beyond this threshold lead to exclusion.
