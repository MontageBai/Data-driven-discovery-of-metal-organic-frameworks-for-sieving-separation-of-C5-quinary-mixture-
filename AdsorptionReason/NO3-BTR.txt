MOF Name: NO3-BTR

Inferred Pore Behavior:
The experimental data for NO3-BTR indicates that adsorption is "Temperature-dependent" and occurs via "Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups". This suggests a flexible or dynamic pore rather than a rigid size exclusion mechanism.
*   **Adsorbed at 298 K, 100 kPa:**
    *   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å
*   **Adsorbed at 230 K, 100 kPa:**
    *   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å

The largest molecule explicitly confirmed to adsorb at standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar) is methane with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. Although the MOF's pores are flexible, the experimental data does not provide any evidence that this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules significantly larger than methane. The absence of larger adsorbed molecules in the provided data, despite the dynamic mechanism, implies a practical upper limit to the "temporary deviation" at standard conditions.

**MOF Name: NO3-BTR**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (298 K, 100 kPa)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (230 K, 100 kPa)

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of methane (3.877 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to adsorb at 298 K. While NO3-BTR exhibits temperature-dependent temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups, there is no experimental data to suggest this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed under standard conditions.

**MOF Name: NO3-BTR**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (298 K, 100 kPa)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (230 K, 100 kPa)

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of methane (3.877 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to adsorb at 298 K. While NO3-BTR exhibits temperature-dependent temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups, there is no experimental data to suggest this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed under standard conditions.

**MOF Name: NO3-BTR**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (298 K, 100 kPa)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (230 K, 100 kPa)

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of methane (3.877 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to adsorb at 298 K. While NO3-BTR exhibits temperature-dependent temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups, there is no experimental data to suggest this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed under standard conditions.

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (298 K, 100 kPa)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (230 K, 100 kPa)

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of methane (3.877 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to adsorb at 298 K. While NO3-BTR exhibits temperature-dependent temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups, there is no experimental data to suggest this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, it is predicted that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed under standard conditions.

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of n-pentane (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of methane (3.877 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to adsorb at 298 K. While NO3-BTR exhibits temperature-dependent temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups, there is no experimental data to suggest this flexibility is sufficient to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, it is predicted that n-pentane cannot be adsorbed under standard conditions.
