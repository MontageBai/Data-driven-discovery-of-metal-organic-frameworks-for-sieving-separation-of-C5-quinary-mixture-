MOF Name: Zn2Cd(NH2BDC)3DABCO
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn2Cd(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Zn2Cd(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
The largest molecule shown to be adsorbed is methane with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. There are no molecules reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. Therefore, based on the provided data, the MOF's effective pore size is inferred to be at least 3.877 Å. Given that only small molecules have been demonstrated to adsorb, and the mechanism is stated as "Size exclusion", it is highly probable that the pore size is tightly defined, meaning molecules significantly larger than the largest adsorbed probe would be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally shown to be adsorbed by Zn2Cd(NH2BDC)3DABCO (methane, 3.877 Å), and considering the observed adsorption mechanism is "Size exclusion", it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
