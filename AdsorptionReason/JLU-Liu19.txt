MOF Name: JLU-Liu19
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for JLU-Liu19:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The experimental data explicitly states the MOF's mechanism as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale".

This indicates that JLU-Liu19 can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 3.200 Å. Given that the MOF's primary mode of operation is described as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", it is designed to selectively exclude molecules based on subtle differences in their kinetic dimensions, especially at the smaller end of the size spectrum.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu19 through the provided data, it is highly probable that isoprene will be excluded by the material's sub-nanometer pore size exclusion mechanism. The large difference in size suggests it exceeds the effective pore aperture.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu19 through the provided data, it is highly probable that cis-2-pentene will be excluded by the material's sub-nanometer pore size exclusion mechanism. The large difference in size suggests it exceeds the effective pore aperture.

1-pentene Dimensions:

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu19 through the provided data, it is highly probable that 1-pentene will be excluded by the material's sub-nanometer pore size exclusion mechanism. The large difference in size suggests it exceeds the effective pore aperture.
