MOF Name: [Zn3(OH)2(pzdc)(atz)]$DMA (2,DMA)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn3(OH)2(pzdc)(atz)]$DMA (2,DMA):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, Kinetic sieving, under 1 bar)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, Kinetic sieving, under 1 bar)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, Kinetic sieving, under 1 bar)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)

According to the provided instructions, the MOF’s inferred effective pore size should ideally lie between:
- `max_intermediate_adsorbed` = 5.051 Å (Propylene)
- `min_intermediate_nonadsorbed` = 3.877 Å (Methane)

However, a direct contradiction exists as `max_intermediate_adsorbed (5.051 Å)` is greater than `min_intermediate_nonadsorbed (3.877 Å)`. This implies that a simple, single effective pore size range `[max_intermediate_adsorbed, min_intermediate_nonadsorbed)` cannot be strictly formed from the given data based purely on the intermediate dimension for all observed mechanisms. This suggests a complex pore geometry, specific molecular interactions, or an anomaly in the data regarding the 'size exclusion' definition for certain molecules.

Given this inconsistency, the prediction for isoprene relies on comparing its characteristics to the most relevant experimentally observed molecules.
- Target molecule: **isoprene** dimensions are 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 6.093 Å**.
- The largest molecule observed to adsorb (even conditionally via kinetic sieving) is Propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å. Kinetic sieving generally implies a very tight fit.
- Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), it is highly unlikely to be accommodated by the MOF pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**.

Given this inconsistency, the prediction for cis-2-pentene relies on comparing its characteristics to the most relevant experimentally observed molecules.
- Target molecule: **cis-2-pentene** dimensions are 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 5.572 Å**.
- The largest molecule observed to adsorb (even conditionally via kinetic sieving) is Propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å. Kinetic sieving generally implies a very tight fit for the molecule.
- Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), and Propylene already experiences a tight fit, it is unlikely that cis-2-pentene can be accommodated.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**.

Given this inconsistency, the prediction for 1-pentene relies on comparing its characteristics to the most relevant experimentally observed molecules.
- Target molecule: **1-pentene** dimensions are 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 4.995 Å**.
- This is an alkene, similar in nature to Ethylene and Propylene, which were both adsorbed (conditionally, via kinetic sieving).
- 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly smaller than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), which successfully adsorbed via kinetic sieving. Given that a larger molecule (Propylene) can pass, a slightly smaller molecule of a similar type is expected to also pass, likely experiencing kinetic sieving.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**.

- Target molecule: **trans-2-pentene** dimensions are 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 4.733 Å**.
- This is an alkene, similar in nature to Ethylene and Propylene, which were both adsorbed (conditionally, via kinetic sieving).
- trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), which successfully adsorbed via kinetic sieving. Given that a larger molecule (Propylene) can pass, a smaller molecule of a similar type is expected to also pass, likely experiencing kinetic sieving.

MOF Name: [Zn3(OH)2(pzdc)(atz)]$DMA (2,DMA)
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn3(OH)2(pzdc)(atz)]$DMA (2,DMA):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Given this inconsistency, the prediction for n-pentane relies on comparing its characteristics to the most relevant experimentally observed molecules.
- Target molecule: **n-pentane** dimensions are 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 4.364 Å**.
- This is an alkane, similar in chemical nature to propane and methane.
- Propane (intermediate dimension 4.354 Å) is reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion". Methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) is also "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion".
- Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is slightly larger than propane's (4.354 Å), and propane, another alkane, was excluded by size, it is highly likely that n-pentane will also be excluded. The consistent exclusion of alkanes (methane, propane) suggests a selective size/shape exclusion for this class of molecules.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**.
