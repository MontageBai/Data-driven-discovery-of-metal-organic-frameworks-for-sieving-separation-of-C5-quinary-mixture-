MOF Name: UTSA-74
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-74:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the provided experimental data, UTSA-74 is shown to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. There is no information provided about larger molecules being adsorbed or molecules being rejected due to size exclusion. Therefore, we can infer that the effective pore size of UTSA-74 is at least 3.200 Å, and likely not significantly larger than this, given the limited scope of adsorbed molecules.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the largest known adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å) for UTSA-74, and there is no evidence of UTSA-74 adsorbing molecules of this size, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-74 due to size exclusion.

Therefore, we can infer that the effective pore size of UTSA-74 is at least 3.200 Å, and likely not significantly larger than this, given the limited scope of adsorbed molecules.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the largest known adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å) for UTSA-74, and there is no evidence of UTSA-74 adsorbing molecules of this size, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-74 due to size exclusion.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the largest known adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å) for UTSA-74, and there is no evidence of UTSA-74 adsorbing molecules of this size, it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-74 due to size exclusion.
