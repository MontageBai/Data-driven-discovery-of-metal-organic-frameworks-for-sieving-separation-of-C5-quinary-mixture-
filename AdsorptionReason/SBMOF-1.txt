MOF Name: SBMOF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SBMOF-1:
-   **Xenon (Xe):** Dimensions = 4.320×4.320×4.320 Å. Intermediate dimension = 4.320 Å. **Adsorbed**. The mechanism is described as "Van der Waals interactions with aromatic rings," suggesting specific favorable interactions.
-   **Krypton (Kr):** Dimensions = 3.680×3.680×3.680 Å. Intermediate dimension = 3.680 Å. **NOT Adsorbed**. The reason is explicitly stated as "Size exclusion."

**Inferred Effective Pore Size Contradiction:**
Following the prompt's instructions, the inferred effective pore size should be:
-   Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (xenon: 4.320 Å).
-   Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (krypton: 3.680 Å) *due to size exclusion*.

This leads to an inferred range of [4.320 Å, 3.680 Å), which is logically impossible as 4.320 Å > 3.680 Å. This indicates that a simple, single "effective pore size" based purely on intermediate dimension and general size exclusion does not fully explain the selective adsorption behavior of SBMOF-1. The material exhibits a complex selectivity where a larger molecule (xenon) is adsorbed due to specific interactions, while a smaller one (krypton) is explicitly excluded by size.

**Interpretation for Prediction:**
Given the explicit statement that Krypton (intermediate dimension 3.680 Å) is "Size excluded," this suggests that for general passage and without specific favorable interactions, the effective pore size is *less than* 3.680 Å. Xenon's adsorption (intermediate dimension 4.320 Å) is specifically attributed to "Van der Waals interactions with aromatic rings," implying a highly specific, perhaps kinetic, or site-specific adsorption mechanism that allows a molecule seemingly larger than the general size exclusion limit to be adsorbed. The target molecules (isoprene, pentenes, n-pentane) are complex organic molecules, not noble gases, and are unlikely to benefit from the same specific aromatic interactions that allow Xenon to be adsorbed. Therefore, the "Size exclusion" observed for Krypton is a more relevant limiting factor for these types of molecules.

**Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:**
-   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

**Conclusion:**
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than Krypton's intermediate dimension (3.680 Å), which was explicitly excluded by "Size exclusion," and isoprene is unlikely to benefit from the specific adsorption mechanism observed for Xenon, it cannot be adsorbed by SBMOF-1.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

**Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:**
-   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

**Conclusion:**
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than Krypton's intermediate dimension (3.680 Å), which was explicitly excluded by "Size exclusion," and cis-2-pentene is unlikely to benefit from the specific adsorption mechanism observed for Xenon, it cannot be adsorbed by SBMOF-1.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than Krypton's intermediate dimension (3.680 Å), which was explicitly excluded by "Size exclusion," and 1-pentene is unlikely to benefit from the specific adsorption mechanism observed for Xenon, it cannot be adsorbed by SBMOF-1.
