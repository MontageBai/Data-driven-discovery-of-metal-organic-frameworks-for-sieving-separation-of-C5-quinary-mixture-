To determine whether Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr) can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we first infer the MOF’s effective pore size based on the provided experimental data.

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size for Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr):**

*   **Experimental Adsorption Data:**
    *   `Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr),acetylene,Yes,Not Reported,Size exclusion,270 K, 300 K, 310 K,Not Applicable`
    *   `Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr),carbon dioxide,Yes,Not Reported,Size exclusion,270 K, 300 K, 310 K,Not Applicable`

*   **Guest Molecule Probe Sizes (Intermediate Dimension):**
    *   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å**
    *   Carbon Dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å**

*   **Inference:**
    From the experimental data, Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr) is shown to adsorb both acetylene and carbon dioxide, which both have an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This implies that the effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr) is at least **3.200 Å**.
    Crucially, the provided data *does not include any guest molecules that were not adsorbed due to size exclusion*. Therefore, it is not possible to establish an upper bound for the effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr) solely based on the given data. The inferred effective pore size is `[3.200 Å, X)` where X is undefined.

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

We will now evaluate each target guest molecule based on its intermediate dimension and the inferred pore size.

MOF Name: Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr): The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, as no guest molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be established from the provided experimental data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the explicitly adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å). However, based solely on the provided data, and given the absence of information on larger molecules being rejected due to size exclusion, it cannot be definitively concluded that isoprene *cannot* be adsorbed. Therefore, based on the available data, adsorption is predicted as possible.

MOF Name: Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr): The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, as no guest molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be established from the provided experimental data.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the explicitly adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å). However, based solely on the provided data, and given the absence of information on larger molecules being rejected due to size exclusion, it cannot be definitively concluded that cis-2-pentene *cannot* be adsorbed. Therefore, based on the available data, adsorption is predicted as possible.

Inferred effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr): The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, as no guest molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be established from the provided experimental data.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of the explicitly adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å). However, based solely on the provided data, and given the absence of information on larger molecules being rejected due to size exclusion, it cannot be definitively concluded that 1-pentene *cannot* be adsorbed. Therefore, based on the available data, adsorption is predicted as possible.

Inferred effective pore size of Cu2(pzdc)2(pyr): The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, as no guest molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be established from the provided experimental data.
