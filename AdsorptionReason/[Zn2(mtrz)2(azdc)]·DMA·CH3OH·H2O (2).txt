MOF Name: [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2)

**Inferred Effective Pore Size (from experimental data):**
The only experimental data provided for [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2) states that `carbon dioxide` is adsorbed.
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate dimension = 3.200 Å
- The reason for adsorption is given as "Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape".

While there is no explicit data point for a molecule being *rejected* by size exclusion for this MOF, the mention of "Size-exclusion effect" as the mechanism for `carbon dioxide`'s *adsorption* suggests that the MOF's pores are relatively narrow. This implies that the pores are specifically tailored to allow molecules of carbon dioxide's size (3.200 Å intermediate dimension) to pass, and would likely exclude molecules with significantly larger dimensions. Without an explicit upper limit from a rejected molecule, we infer that the effective pore size is likely just above 3.200 Å.

MOF Name: [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape)

The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is attributed to a "Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape". This mechanism suggests that the MOF's pores are specifically sized such that carbon dioxide can pass through, and implicitly, molecules with dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å would be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF's adsorption behavior for CO2 is characterized by a "size-exclusion effect", it is highly probable that isoprene is too large to pass through the MOF's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape)

The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is attributed to a "Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape". This mechanism suggests that the MOF's pores are specifically sized such that carbon dioxide can pass through, and implicitly, molecules with dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å would be excluded.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF's adsorption behavior for CO2 is characterized by a "size-exclusion effect", it is highly probable that cis-2-pentene is too large to pass through the MOF's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2)
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape)

The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is attributed to a "Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape". This mechanism suggests that the MOF's pores are specifically sized such that carbon dioxide can pass through, and implicitly, molecules with dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å would be excluded.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF's adsorption behavior for CO2 is characterized by a "size-exclusion effect", it is highly probable that 1-pentene is too large to pass through the MOF's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2)
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2(mtrz)2(azdc)]·DMA·CH3OH·H2O (2):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape)

The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is attributed to a "Size-exclusion effect based on pore size and shape". This mechanism suggests that the MOF's pores are specifically sized such that carbon dioxide can pass through, and implicitly, molecules with dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å would be excluded.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF's adsorption behavior for CO2 is characterized by a "size-exclusion effect", it is highly probable that trans-2-pentene is too large to pass through the MOF's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF's adsorption behavior for CO2 is characterized by a "size-exclusion effect", it is highly probable that n-pentane is too large to pass through the MOF's pores.
