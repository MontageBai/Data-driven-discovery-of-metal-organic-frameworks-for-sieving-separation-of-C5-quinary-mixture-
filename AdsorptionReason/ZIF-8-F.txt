MOF Name: ZIF-8-F

**Inferred MOF's Effective Pore Size for ZIF-8-F:**
From experimental data for ZIF-8-F:
*   Krypton: 3.680×3.680×3.680 Å → Intermediate = 3.680 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Xenon: 4.320×4.320×4.320 Å → Intermediate = 4.320 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

The largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules is 4.320 Å (Xenon).
There is no data provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, we can only infer that ZIF-8-F is capable of adsorbing molecules with an intermediate dimension *up to at least* 4.320 Å. Based on the principle of size exclusion, if a molecule's intermediate dimension is greater than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension, and no larger molecules are explicitly stated to be adsorbed, it is inferred that the MOF cannot adsorb it due to size limitations.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: ZIF-8-F**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F based on size exclusion is Xenon, with an intermediate dimension of 4.320 Å.
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å.
Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F (4.320 Å for Xenon), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZIF-8-F**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F based on size exclusion is Xenon, with an intermediate dimension of 4.320 Å.
cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å.
Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F (4.320 Å for Xenon), it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZIF-8-F**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F based on size exclusion is Xenon, with an intermediate dimension of 4.320 Å.
1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å.
Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F (4.320 Å for Xenon), it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZIF-8-F**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F based on size exclusion is Xenon, with an intermediate dimension of 4.320 Å.
trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å.
Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F (4.320 Å for Xenon), it is predicted that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZIF-8-F**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F based on size exclusion is Xenon, with an intermediate dimension of 4.320 Å.
n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å.
Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is slightly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F (4.320 Å for Xenon), it is predicted that n-pentane cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-8-F due to size exclusion.
