MOF Name: CuBDC MOF nanosheets
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CuBDC MOF nanosheets:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- No "Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)" data points are provided for CuBDC MOF nanosheets.

Inferred effective pore size of CuBDC MOF nanosheets:
Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide, the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. Without any molecules explicitly reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be inferred from the provided data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). However, because there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for CuBDC MOF nanosheets (i.e., no molecule listed as "No" for adsorption due to size), an upper bound for the pore size cannot be established from the given information. Therefore, based solely on the provided experimental data, there is no evidence to suggest that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: CuBDC MOF nanosheets
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CuBDC MOF nanosheets:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- No "Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)" data points are provided for CuBDC MOF nanosheets.

Inferred effective pore size of CuBDC MOF nanosheets:
Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide, the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. Without any molecules explicitly reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be inferred from the provided data.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). However, because there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for CuBDC MOF nanosheets, an upper bound for the pore size cannot be established from the given information. Therefore, based solely on the provided experimental data, there is no evidence to suggest that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CuBDC MOF nanosheets:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- No "Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)" data points are provided for CuBDC MOF nanosheets.

Inferred effective pore size of CuBDC MOF nanosheets:

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). However, because there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for CuBDC MOF nanosheets, an upper bound for the pore size cannot be established from the given information. Therefore, based solely on the provided experimental data, there is no evidence to suggest that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). However, because there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for CuBDC MOF nanosheets, an upper bound for the pore size cannot be established from the given information. Therefore, based solely on the provided experimental data, there is no evidence to suggest that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed carbon dioxide (3.200 Å). However, because there is no experimental data indicating a size exclusion limit for CuBDC MOF nanosheets, an upper bound for the pore size cannot be established from the given information.
