MOF Name: CPL-1-NH2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPL-1-NH2:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: "Adsorption site selective occupation strategy based on differences in molecular orientation, End-on orientation, weak interaction due to steric hindrance and shielding by -NH2 groups")

Inferred Effective Pore Size / Adsorption Limit for CPL-1-NH2:
The MOF is able to adsorb acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å), indicating its pores are at least large enough to accommodate molecules of this size. However, carbon dioxide, which has the *same* intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), is *not* adsorbed due to "steric hindrance and weak interaction" related to its orientation. This suggests that CPL-1-NH2 exhibits a highly selective adsorption mechanism, likely kinetic sieving or shape selectivity, where even small differences in molecular shape or orientation at the 3.200 Å scale significantly impact adsorption. Given that a molecule of 3.200 Å is explicitly prevented from adsorbing due to steric effects, it is highly improbable that molecules with significantly larger intermediate dimensions could pass through the pores or be adsorbed. Therefore, the effective upper limit for the intermediate dimension of molecules that can be adsorbed by CPL-1-NH2 appears to be approximately 3.200 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the effective upper limit of ~3.200 Å for adsorption observed for CPL-1-NH2, it cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
