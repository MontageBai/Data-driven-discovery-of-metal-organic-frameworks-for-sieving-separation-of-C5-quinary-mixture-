MOF Name: MIL-101
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-101:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the adsorption of ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å), the inferred effective pore size of MIL-101 is at least 6.501 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (ethylbenzene, 6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible with the pores of MIL-101.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
