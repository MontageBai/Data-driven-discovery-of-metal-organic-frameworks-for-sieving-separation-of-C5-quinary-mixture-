MOF Name: HIAM-301

**Detailed Reasoning for HIAM-301's Pore Characteristics:**

From the experimental data:
*   **Propylene:** Dimensions: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Molecular sieving via deformed pore structure)
*   **Propane:** Dimensions: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (Exclusion based on deformed pore structure)

HIAM-301 exhibits complex sieving behavior. It successfully adsorbs propylene (intermediate dimension 5.051 Å), yet it explicitly excludes propane (intermediate dimension 4.354 Å) due to "Exclusion based on deformed pore structure". This indicates that the adsorption mechanism is not a simple size exclusion based solely on the intermediate dimension. Instead, it involves a kinetic sieving effect where the molecule's specific shape and chemical class (e.g., alkene vs. alkane) play a crucial role in its ability to interact with and pass through the deformable pore structure.

Therefore, for HIAM-301:
*   Molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 5.051 Å *can* be adsorbed, provided their shape is compatible with the "deformed pore structure" (similar to propylene).
*   Alkanes, specifically propane (intermediate dimension 4.354 Å), are excluded, implying a shape-selective barrier for this class of molecules.
*   Molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 5.051 Å are likely too large to pass, regardless of their specific shape or the pore's deformability.

MOF Name: HIAM-301
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
*   Comparison: The largest intermediate dimension among known adsorbed molecules is 5.051 Å for propylene. Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than this value. While HIAM-301 shows kinetic sieving via a deformed pore structure, there is no experimental evidence to suggest it can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions exceeding that of propylene. Thus, it is highly probable that isoprene is too large.

Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
*   Comparison: The largest intermediate dimension among known adsorbed molecules is 5.051 Å for propylene. Cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than this value. Similar to isoprene, even with a deformed pore structure, it is unlikely for HIAM-301 to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than what has been experimentally proven to pass (propylene).

Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
*   Comparison: 1-pentene is an alkene, similar in chemical class to propylene (adsorbed, intermediate dimension 5.051 Å). Its intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly smaller than that of propylene. Given that propylene can be adsorbed via "Molecular sieving via deformed pore structure" and the exclusion of propane is attributed to shape-specific interaction with alkanes, it is reasonable to infer that 1-pentene, being an alkene with a compatible intermediate dimension, would also be able to pass through the deformed pore structure.

Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
*   Comparison: Trans-2-pentene is an alkene, similar to propylene (adsorbed, intermediate dimension 5.051 Å). Its intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than that of propylene. While it is larger than propane (excluded, intermediate dimension 4.354 Å), the exclusion of propane was attributed to a shape-specific interaction with the deformed pore structure for alkanes. As an alkene, trans-2-pentene is more likely to exhibit similar passage characteristics to propylene (an alkene) rather than propane (an alkane) through the deformable pores.

Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å
*   Comparison: N-pentane is an alkane, similar in chemical class to propane (not adsorbed, intermediate dimension 4.354 Å). Propane was explicitly excluded due to "Exclusion based on deformed pore structure". N-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is very close to and even slightly larger than propane's. Given the observed shape-selective exclusion of alkanes (propane) by HIAM-301, it is highly probable that n-pentane, being a longer chain alkane, would also be subject to the same exclusion mechanism.
