MOF Name: NKMOF-1-Ni
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NKMOF-1-Ni:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (indicating pore is at least this large)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion, indicating pore is smaller than this)

Inferred effective pore size of NKMOF-1-Ni lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å). This means the MOF can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to, but not including, 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å) for NKMOF-1-Ni, it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: NKMOF-1-Ni
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NKMOF-1-Ni:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (indicating pore is at least this large)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion, indicating pore is smaller than this)

Inferred effective pore size of NKMOF-1-Ni lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å). This means the MOF can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to, but not including, 3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å) for NKMOF-1-Ni, it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.
