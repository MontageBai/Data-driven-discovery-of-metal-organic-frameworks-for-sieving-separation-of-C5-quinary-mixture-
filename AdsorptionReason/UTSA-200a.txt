MOF Name: UTSA-200a
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-200a (at 298 K, 1 bar):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion - based on multiple entries indicating size exclusion and optimized pore size between C2H2 and C2H4)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-200a:
The MOF adsorbs acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å).
The MOF does *not* adsorb methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å), ethylene (intermediate dimension 4.047 Å), or ethane (intermediate dimension 4.175 Å) due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the effective pore size of UTSA-200a is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å.
Inferred effective pore size range: **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-200a (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-200a due to size exclusion.
