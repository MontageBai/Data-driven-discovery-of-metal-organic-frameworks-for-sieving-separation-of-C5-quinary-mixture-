Here is the analysis and prediction for each guest molecule based solely on the provided data:

**MOF Name: Cu3(HITP)2**

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Cu3(HITP)2:**
From the experimental data provided for Cu3(HITP)2:
*   Ammonia: 3.826×3.610×3.060 → Intermediate = 3.610 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Based on this single data point, the effective pore size of Cu3(HITP)2 can be inferred to be at least 3.610 Å. However, no data for non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion) is provided, which means an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be established from the given information.

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
Based on the provided rule, a molecule can be predicted to adsorb if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a known adsorbed molecule. For Cu3(HITP)2, the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule is 3.610 Å (ammonia).

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by Cu3(HITP)2 (3.610 Å), the condition for predicting "Can Adsorb" (i.e., intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met. As no other experimental data is provided to suggest adsorption of molecules of this size or to define an upper limit for size exclusion, and following the strict evaluation criteria, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
Based on the provided rule, a molecule can be predicted to adsorb if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a known adsorbed molecule. For Cu3(HITP)2, the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule is 3.610 Å (ammonia).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is greater than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by Cu3(HITP)2 (3.610 Å), the condition for predicting "Can Adsorb" (i.e., intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met. As no other experimental data is provided to suggest adsorption of molecules of this size or to define an upper limit for size exclusion, and following the strict evaluation criteria, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
Based on the provided rule, a molecule can be predicted to adsorb if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a known adsorbed molecule. For Cu3(HITP)2, the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule is 3.610 Å (ammonia).

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is greater than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by Cu3(HITP)2 (3.610 Å), the condition for predicting "Can Adsorb" (i.e., intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met. As no other experimental data is provided to suggest adsorption of molecules of this size or to define an upper limit for size exclusion, and following the strict evaluation criteria, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
Based on the provided rule, a molecule can be predicted to adsorb if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a known adsorbed molecule. For Cu3(HITP)2, the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule is 3.610 Å (ammonia).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is greater than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by Cu3(HITP)2 (3.610 Å), the condition for predicting "Can Adsorb" (i.e., intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met. As no other experimental data is provided to suggest adsorption of molecules of this size or to define an upper limit for size exclusion, and following the strict evaluation criteria, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".

**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
Based on the provided rule, a molecule can be predicted to adsorb if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a known adsorbed molecule. For Cu3(HITP)2, the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally confirmed adsorbed molecule is 3.610 Å (ammonia).

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is greater than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by Cu3(HITP)2 (3.610 Å), the condition for predicting "Can Adsorb" (i.e., intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met. As no other experimental data is provided to suggest adsorption of molecules of this size or to define an upper limit for size exclusion, and following the strict evaluation criteria, the prediction is "Cannot Adsorb".
