MOF Name: FJUT-4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of FJUT-4: Based *solely* on the provided data, FJUT-4 adsorbs carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so a strict upper bound for the pore size cannot be inferred from the given information alone.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by FJUT-4 (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Given that the primary mechanism for non-adsorption for MOFs is often size exclusion, and without any experimental evidence to suggest FJUT-4 can adsorb molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to steric hindrance.

MOF Name: FJUT-4
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of FJUT-4: Based *solely* on the provided data, FJUT-4 adsorbs carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so a strict upper bound for the pore size cannot be inferred from the given information alone.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by FJUT-4 (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Given that the primary mechanism for non-adsorption for MOFs is often size exclusion, and without any experimental evidence to suggest FJUT-4 can adsorb molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is highly probable that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to steric hindrance.

MOF Name: FJUT-4
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of FJUT-4: Based *solely* on the provided data, FJUT-4 adsorbs carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so a strict upper bound for the pore size cannot be inferred from the given information alone.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by FJUT-4 (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Given that the primary mechanism for non-adsorption for MOFs is often size exclusion, and without any experimental evidence to suggest FJUT-4 can adsorb molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is highly probable that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to steric hindrance.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of FJUT-4: Based *solely* on the provided data, FJUT-4 adsorbs carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å.

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by FJUT-4 (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Given that the primary mechanism for non-adsorption for MOFs is often size exclusion, and without any experimental evidence to suggest FJUT-4 can adsorb molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is highly probable that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to steric hindrance.

n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by FJUT-4 (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Given that the primary mechanism for non-adsorption for MOFs is often size exclusion, and without any experimental evidence to suggest FJUT-4 can adsorb molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is highly probable that n-pentane cannot be adsorbed due to steric hindrance.
