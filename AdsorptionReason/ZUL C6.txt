MOF Name: ZUL C6

**Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for ZUL C6:
*   **3-methylpentane:** 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **2,2-dimethylbutane:** 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, via Gate-opening effect at 16 kPa. Since the standard conditions are 1 bar (approx. 100 kPa), this molecule would be adsorbed.)

Based on this, ZUL C6 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 6.008 Å without explicit pressure requirement, and can adsorb molecules up to 6.545 Å by utilizing a "gate-opening effect" at 1 bar. Therefore, the effective pore size can accommodate molecules up to at least 6.545 Å.

MOF Name: ZUL C6
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZUL C6:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, via Gate-opening effect at 1 bar conditions)

Inferred effective pore size of ZUL C6 allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 6.545 Å, with molecules larger than 6.008 Å potentially utilizing a gate-opening mechanism.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å) but less than 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å), and 2,2-dimethylbutane is adsorbed via a gate-opening effect, isoprene is also expected to be adsorbed by ZUL C6, likely facilitated by the same gate-opening mechanism under standard conditions.

MOF Name: ZUL C6
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZUL C6:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, via Gate-opening effect at 1 bar conditions)

Inferred effective pore size of ZUL C6 allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 6.545 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than that of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which is adsorbed by ZUL C6, cis-2-pentene is expected to be adsorbed.
