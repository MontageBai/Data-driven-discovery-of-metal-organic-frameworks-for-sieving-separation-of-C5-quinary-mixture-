MOF Name: GeFSIX-dps-Zn

**MOF Name: GeFSIX-dps-Zn**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for GeFSIX-dps-Zn:
*   Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn:
Based on the experimental data, molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.961 Å (propyne) can be adsorbed, while molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) are excluded by size. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn is approximately **3.961 Å ≤ Effective Pore Size < 4.047 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by GeFSIX-dps-Zn due to size exclusion.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for GeFSIX-dps-Zn:
*   Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn:
The inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn is approximately **3.961 Å ≤ Effective Pore Size < 4.047 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by GeFSIX-dps-Zn due to size exclusion.

Inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn:
The inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Zn is approximately **3.961 Å ≤ Effective Pore Size < 4.047 Å**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by GeFSIX-dps-Zn due to size exclusion.
