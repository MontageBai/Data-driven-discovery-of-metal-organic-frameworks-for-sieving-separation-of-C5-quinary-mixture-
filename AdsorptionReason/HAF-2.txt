MOF Name: HAF-2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Complete pore blockage)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (Complete pore blockage)

Inferred effective pore size of HAF-2: Since both propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) and propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) are not adsorbed due to complete pore blockage, the effective pore size of HAF-2 must be less than the smallest intermediate dimension of these non-adsorbed molecules. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of HAF-2 is **less than 4.354 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of HAF-2's effective pore size (< 4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by HAF-2.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Complete pore blockage)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (Complete pore blockage)

Inferred effective pore size of HAF-2: Based on the non-adsorption of both propylene and propane due to complete pore blockage, the effective pore size of HAF-2 is inferred to be **less than 4.354 Å**.
