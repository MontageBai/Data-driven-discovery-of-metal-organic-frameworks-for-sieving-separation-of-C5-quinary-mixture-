MOF Name: TIFSIX-14-Cu-i
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TIFSIX-14-Cu-i:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of TIFSIX-14-Cu-i allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but strictly less than 5.051 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by TIFSIX-14-Cu-i due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: TIFSIX-14-Cu-i
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TIFSIX-14-Cu-i:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of TIFSIX-14-Cu-i allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but strictly less than 5.051 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by TIFSIX-14-Cu-i due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: TIFSIX-14-Cu-i
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TIFSIX-14-Cu-i:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of TIFSIX-14-Cu-i allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but strictly less than 5.051 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range ([3.961 Å, 5.051 Å)), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by TIFSIX-14-Cu-i. The experimental data already shows a kinetic sieving effect where similar molecules are excluded at slightly larger intermediate dimensions, suggesting that 1-pentene might be able to pass through the pore given its intermediate dimension is just below the exclusion threshold for propylene.

MOF Name: TIFSIX-14-Cu-i
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TIFSIX-14-Cu-i:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of TIFSIX-14-Cu-i allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but strictly less than 5.051 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range ([3.961 Å, 5.051 Å)), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by TIFSIX-14-Cu-i. The experimental data already shows a kinetic sieving effect where similar molecules are excluded at slightly larger intermediate dimensions.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TIFSIX-14-Cu-i:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of TIFSIX-14-Cu-i allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but strictly less than 5.051 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range ([3.961 Å, 5.051 Å)), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by TIFSIX-14-Cu-i. The experimental data already shows a kinetic sieving effect where similar molecules are excluded at slightly larger intermediate dimensions.
