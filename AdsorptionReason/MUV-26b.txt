MOF Name: MUV-26b
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MUV-26b:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MUV-26b:
Based on the provided data, MUV-26b is known to adsorb carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). This indicates that its effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data for non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion) is provided for MUV-26b, which means an upper limit for its pore size cannot be definitively inferred from the given experimental data alone.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by MUV-26b in the provided data. In the absence of experimental evidence supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, and given the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, it is predicted that isoprene, being substantially larger, will be excluded.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MUV-26b
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MUV-26b:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MUV-26b:
Based on the provided data, MUV-26b is known to adsorb carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). This indicates that its effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data for non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion) is provided for MUV-26b, which means an upper limit for its pore size cannot be definitively inferred from the given experimental data alone.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by MUV-26b in the provided data. In the absence of experimental evidence supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, and given the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene, being substantially larger, will be excluded.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by MUV-26b in the provided data. In the absence of experimental evidence supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, and given the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, it is predicted that 1-pentene, being substantially larger, will be excluded.
