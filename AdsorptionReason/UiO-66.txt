**MOF Name: UIO-66**

**Analysis of UIO-66's Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental adsorption data for UIO-66:
*   **Toluene:** 8.117×6.501×3.750 Å. Intermediate dimension = **6.501 Å**. (Adsorbed)
*   **Carbon dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å. Intermediate dimension = **3.200 Å**. (Adsorbed)
*   **Methane:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å. Intermediate dimension = **3.877 Å**. (Adsorbed)

Based on these adsorbed molecules, the effective pore size of UIO-66 must be large enough to accommodate the largest intermediate dimension of the adsorbed molecules, which is **6.501 Å (from toluene)**. Since all provided experimental data show adsorption, we can infer that the MOF's critical pore dimension is at least 6.501 Å. We do not have data for non-adsorbed molecules for UIO-66 to establish an upper bound based on size exclusion. Therefore, we assume any molecule with an intermediate dimension equal to or smaller than 6.501 Å should be able to pass, strictly based on size.

**Evaluation for Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: UIO-66**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF UIO-66 is known to adsorb toluene (8.117×6.501×3.750 Å, intermediate dimension = 6.501 Å).
*   Isoprene dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å. Intermediate dimension = **6.093 Å**.
*   Since the intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is smaller than that of toluene (6.501 Å), which is adsorbed, isoprene is predicted to be adsorbed by UIO-66.

**MOF Name: UIO-66**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF UIO-66 is known to adsorb toluene (8.117×6.501×3.750 Å, intermediate dimension = 6.501 Å).
*   cis-2-pentene dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å. Intermediate dimension = **5.572 Å**.
*   Since the intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is smaller than that of toluene (6.501 Å), which is adsorbed, cis-2-pentene is predicted to be adsorbed by UIO-66.

**MOF Name: UIO-66**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF UIO-66 is known to adsorb toluene (8.117×6.501×3.750 Å, intermediate dimension = 6.501 Å).
*   1-pentene dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å. Intermediate dimension = **4.995 Å**.
*   Since the intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is smaller than that of toluene (6.501 Å), which is adsorbed, 1-pentene is predicted to be adsorbed by UIO-66.

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF UIO-66 is known to adsorb toluene (8.117×6.501×3.750 Å, intermediate dimension = 6.501 Å).
*   trans-2-pentene dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å. Intermediate dimension = **4.733 Å**.
*   Since the intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is smaller than that of toluene (6.501 Å), which is adsorbed, trans-2-pentene is predicted to be adsorbed by UIO-66.

**MOF Name: UIO-66**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF UIO-66 is known to adsorb toluene (8.117×6.501×3.750 Å, intermediate dimension = 6.501 Å).
*   n-pentane dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å. Intermediate dimension = **4.364 Å**.
*   Since the intermediate dimension of n-pentane (4.364 Å) is smaller than that of toluene (6.501 Å), which is adsorbed, n-pentane is predicted to be adsorbed by UIO-66.
