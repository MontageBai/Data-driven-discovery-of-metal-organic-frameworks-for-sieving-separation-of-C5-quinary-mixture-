MOF Name: Ni(ina)2

Detailed Inference of MOF's Effective Pore Size:
From the experimental data, Ni(ina)2 is reported to adsorb methane:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

Based on this, the effective pore size of Ni(ina)2 must be greater than or equal to 3.877 Å.
The provided data states the MOF enhances "CH4/N2 separation" using "Size exclusion". While an explicit 'No' (non-adsorbed) data point for another molecule is not provided to establish an upper bound for the pore size, the description implies that the MOF's pores are precisely tuned for methane (3.877 Å). Therefore, it is highly probable that molecules significantly larger than methane would be excluded by the size exclusion mechanism, even if no explicit non-adsorption data for larger molecules is present. This suggests a relatively narrow pore aperture optimized for small gas molecules like methane.

MOF Name: Ni(ina)2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Ni(ina)2 adsorbs methane (3.877×3.849×3.918), with an intermediate dimension of **3.877 Å**. The material's mechanism for adsorption is stated as "Size exclusion" in the context of "CH4/N2 separation," implying a pore size precisely tuned for methane.
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**.
Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than methane's (3.877 Å), and the MOF is designed for size-selective adsorption of methane, it is predicted that Ni(ina)2's pores are too small to accommodate isoprene.

MOF Name: Ni(ina)2
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Ni(ina)2 adsorbs methane (3.877×3.849×3.918), with an intermediate dimension of **3.877 Å**. The material's mechanism for adsorption is stated as "Size exclusion" in the context of "CH4/N2 separation," implying a pore size precisely tuned for methane.
cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**.
Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than methane's (3.877 Å), and the MOF is designed for size-selective adsorption of methane, it is predicted that Ni(ina)2's pores are too small to accommodate cis-2-pentene.

MOF Name: Ni(ina)2
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Ni(ina)2 adsorbs methane (3.877×3.849×3.918), with an intermediate dimension of **3.877 Å**. The material's mechanism for adsorption is stated as "Size exclusion" in the context of "CH4/N2 separation," implying a pore size precisely tuned for methane.
1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**.
Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than methane's (3.877 Å), and the MOF is designed for size-selective adsorption of methane, it is predicted that Ni(ina)2's pores are too small to accommodate 1-pentene.

From experimental data, Ni(ina)2 adsorbs methane (3.877×3.849×3.918), with an intermediate dimension of **3.877 Å**. The material's mechanism for adsorption is stated as "Size exclusion" in the context of "CH4/N2 separation," implying a pore size precisely tuned for methane.
trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**.
Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than methane's (3.877 Å), and the MOF is designed for size-selective adsorption of methane, it is predicted that Ni(ina)2's pores are too small to accommodate trans-2-pentene.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Ni(ina)2 adsorbs methane (3.877×3.849×3.918), with an intermediate dimension of **3.877 Å**. The material's mechanism for adsorption is stated as "Size exclusion" in the context of "CH4/N2 separation," implying a pore size precisely tuned for methane.
n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**.
Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than methane's (3.877 Å), and the MOF is designed for size-selective adsorption of methane, it is predicted that Ni(ina)2's pores are too small to accommodate n-pentane.
