MOF Name: MUT-11
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MUT-11:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

The experimental data for MUT-11 shows that it adsorbs molecules like acetylene and carbon dioxide, both having an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. The experimental notes for MUT-11 explicitly state "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" and "Strong interactions and early pore filling due to small pore size". While there is no 'No' data point provided for MUT-11 to set a precise upper bound on its effective pore size, the strong emphasis on "small pore size" and "size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" strongly implies that the pore aperture is very restricted and molecules significantly larger than 3.200 Å will be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is substantially larger than the intermediate dimensions of the molecules known to be adsorbed (3.200 Å), and the material is characterized by a "small pore size" leading to "size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", it cannot be adsorbed by MUT-11.
