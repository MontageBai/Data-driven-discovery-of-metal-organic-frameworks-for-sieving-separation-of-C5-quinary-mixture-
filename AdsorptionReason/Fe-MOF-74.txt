To determine whether Fe-MOF-74 can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we will follow the defined thinking steps, inferring the MOF's effective pore size based on the provided experimental data and then comparing it to the target molecules' dimensions.

**1. Extract and Analyze Experimental Adsorption Data for Fe-MOF-74:**

From the provided data:
*   **Fe-MOF-74, ethylene, Yes, Thermodynamic effect...**
    *   Ethylene dimensions: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å
    *   Intermediate dimension = 4.047 Å
*   **Fe-MOF-74, ethane, Yes, Thermodynamic effect...**
    *   Ethane dimensions: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å
    *   Intermediate dimension = 4.175 Å
*   **Fe-MOF-74, carbon dioxide, Not Reported, Thermodynamic effect...**
    *   Carbon dioxide dimensions: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å
    *   Intermediate dimension = 3.200 Å
    *   *Note*: The status for carbon dioxide is "Not Reported" for adsorption and the reason given is "Thermodynamic effect", not size exclusion. This does not provide information for establishing an upper bound for pore size based on size exclusion.

**2. Infer Fe-MOF-74’s Effective Pore Size based on Size Exclusion Data:**

*   **Adsorbed Molecules (Yes):** The largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules is 4.175 Å (ethane).
*   **Non-Adsorbed Molecules (No due to Size Exclusion):** No molecules are explicitly reported as "No" due to "Size exclusion" as the reason for non-adsorption.

Therefore, we can infer that the effective pore size of Fe-MOF-74 is **greater than or equal to 4.175 Å**. However, without any data point indicating non-adsorption due to size exclusion, we **cannot establish an upper limit** for the pore size based on the provided size exclusion criteria.

**3. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

We will now look up the dimensions and identify the intermediate dimension for each target molecule:

*   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
*   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
*   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
*   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

**4. Comprehensive Judgment:**

The MOF's inferred effective pore size is known to be at least 4.175 Å. All target molecules have intermediate dimensions larger than 4.175 Å. However, the provided experimental data for Fe-MOF-74 does not include any molecule that was "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion". As per the judgment criteria:
*   "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed, → Can Adsorb" (This condition is not met for any of the target molecules as they are all larger than 4.175 Å).
*   "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≥ min_intermediate_nonadsorbed (due to size exclusion), → Cannot Adsorb" (This condition cannot be applied as there is no data to determine `min_intermediate_nonadsorbed` due to size exclusion).

Given the absence of an upper bound for the effective pore size based on size exclusion from the experimental data, we cannot definitively conclude that these larger molecules *cannot* adsorb due to size exclusion. Therefore, based strictly on the provided data and rules for predicting non-adsorption due to size exclusion, the condition to predict "Cannot Adsorb" is not met.

**MOF Name: Fe-MOF-74**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: **Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Fe-MOF-74:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Thermodynamic effect)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Thermodynamic effect)

Inferred effective pore size of Fe-MOF-74:
The MOF is experimentally shown to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 4.175 Å. The provided experimental data does not report any molecule as "Not Adsorbed" specifically due to "Size exclusion". Therefore, an upper limit for the MOF's effective pore size based on size exclusion cannot be inferred from the given data.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimensions of the experimentally adsorbed molecules (ethylene: 4.047 Å, ethane: 4.175 Å). However, as there is no experimental evidence of a molecule failing to adsorb due to size exclusion, the criteria for predicting "Cannot Adsorb" (i.e., molecule's intermediate dimension being greater than or equal to the smallest non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion) cannot be met. Without such evidence, it cannot be definitively ruled out that Fe-MOF-74 *can* adsorb isoprene based *solely* on the provided size exclusion criteria.
