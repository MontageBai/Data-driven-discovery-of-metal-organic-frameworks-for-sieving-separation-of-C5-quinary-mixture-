MOF Name: ZIF-90
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-90 is at least 4.175 Å (the largest intermediate dimension of experimentally adsorbed molecules). No upper bound for the pore size can be definitively established from the provided data, as there are no molecules listed as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of molecules experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by ZIF-90 (ethane, 4.175 Å). Based strictly on the provided experimental data and the principle of size exclusion, there is no direct evidence to suggest that ZIF-90 can adsorb molecules larger than 4.175 Å. Therefore, its adsorption cannot be confirmed from the given data, leading to a prediction of "Cannot Adsorb."

MOF Name: ZIF-90
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-90 is at least 4.175 Å (the largest intermediate dimension of experimentally adsorbed molecules). No upper bound for the pore size can be definitively established from the provided data, as there are no molecules listed as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of molecules experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed by ZIF-90 (ethane, 4.175 Å). Based strictly on the provided experimental data and the principle of size exclusion, there is no direct evidence to suggest that ZIF-90 can adsorb molecules larger than 4.175 Å. Therefore, its adsorption cannot be confirmed from the given data, leading to a prediction of "Cannot Adsorb."
