MOF Name: PCP-IPA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for PCP-IPA:
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Directed adsorption of C3H8 via pore geometry)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Exclusion based on pore geometry, acting as size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of PCP-IPA:
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.354 Å (propane) and excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of PCP-IPA lies in the range [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å). This means the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 4.354 Å and strictly less than 5.051 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by PCP-IPA due to size exclusion.
