**MOF Name: NTU-88**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-88:
*   Propyne (adsorbed): 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = **3.961 Å**
*   Propylene (not adsorbed, size exclusion): 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-88 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and less than 5.051 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by NTU-88 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: NTU-88**

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-88:
*   Propyne (adsorbed): 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = **3.961 Å**
*   Propylene (not adsorbed, size exclusion): 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-88 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and less than 5.051 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by NTU-88 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: NTU-88**

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-88:
*   Propyne (adsorbed): 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = **3.961 Å**
*   Propylene (not adsorbed, size exclusion): 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-88 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and less than 5.051 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (propyne, 3.961 Å) and less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (propylene, 5.051 Å), it is expected to be adsorbed by NTU-88. The pore size appears to accommodate 1-pentene, but may involve a tight fit similar to kinetic sieving if the "Confined-rotational shutters" mechanism noted for propyne vs. propylene is general.

**MOF Name: NTU-88**

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-88:
*   Propyne (adsorbed): 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = **3.961 Å**
*   Propylene (not adsorbed, size exclusion): 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-88 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and less than 5.051 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (propyne, 3.961 Å) and less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (propylene, 5.051 Å), it is expected to be adsorbed by NTU-88. The pore size appears to accommodate trans-2-pentene, but may involve a tight fit similar to kinetic sieving if the "Confined-rotational shutters" mechanism noted for propyne vs. propylene is general.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-88:

*   Propylene (not adsorbed, size exclusion): 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-88 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and less than 5.051 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (propyne, 3.961 Å) and less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (propylene, 5.051 Å), it is expected to be adsorbed by NTU-88. The pore size appears to accommodate n-pentane, but may involve a tight fit similar to kinetic sieving if the "Confined-rotational shutters" mechanism noted for propyne vs. propylene is general.
