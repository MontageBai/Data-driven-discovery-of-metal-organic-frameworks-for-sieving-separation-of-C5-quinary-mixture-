MOF Name: [Ni1.5(4,4’-bipy)1.5(H3L)(H2O)3]·[H2O]7
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Ni1.5(4,4’-bipy)1.5(H3L)(H2O)3]·[H2O]7:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni1.5(4,4’-bipy)1.5(H3L)(H2O)3]·[H2O]7 is:
- Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (CO2 = 3.200 Å).
- Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion (Methane = 3.877 Å).
Therefore, the effective pore size range is approximately **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Ni1.5(4,4’-bipy)1.5(H3L)(H2O)3]·[H2O]7 due to size exclusion.
