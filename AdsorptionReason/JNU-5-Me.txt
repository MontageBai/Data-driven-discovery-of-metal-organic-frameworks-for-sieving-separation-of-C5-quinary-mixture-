MOF Name: JNU-5-Me
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for JNU-5-Me:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Gate-opening behavior exclusively toward acetylene)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion, no gate-opening)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion, no gate-opening)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion, no gate-opening)

Inferred effective pore size of JNU-5-Me:
The experimental data explicitly states "Gate-opening behavior exclusively toward acetylene". This means that while acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) can be adsorbed, this is due to a specific, activated mechanism (gate-opening) that does not occur for other molecules. For all other guest molecules, the MOF exhibits size exclusion. The non-adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) indicates that the MOF's *static* or *non-gate-opened* pore size is effectively smaller than 3.200 Å. Any molecule with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å or larger, other than acetylene, will be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of molecules excluded by JNU-5-Me (e.g., CO2 at 3.200 Å, ethylene at 4.047 Å), and the MOF exhibits exclusive gate-opening behavior only for acetylene, isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
