MOF Name: Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO lies between 3.200 Å (adsorbed) and 3.877 Å (not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Specifically, it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimensions at or above 3.877 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO based on size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO lies between 3.200 Å (adsorbed) and 3.877 Å (not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Specifically, it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimensions at or above 3.877 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO based on size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO lies between 3.200 Å (adsorbed) and 3.877 Å (not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Specifically, it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimensions at or above 3.877 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO based on size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO lies between 3.200 Å (adsorbed) and 3.877 Å (not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Specifically, it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimensions at or above 3.877 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO based on size exclusion.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn3(NH2BDC)3DABCO based on size exclusion.
