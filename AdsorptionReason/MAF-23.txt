MOF Name: MAF-23
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAF-23:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Gating flexibility)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Gating flexibility for molecular sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-23 lies between **3.200 Å** (adsorbed CO2) and **3.877 Å** (non-adsorbed methane). Specifically, the MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å, indicating a very precise molecular sieving effect, even with gating flexibility.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of MAF-23's effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-23. The "Gating flexibility" mechanism observed for methane suggests that while the pores might adapt slightly, they are not large enough to accommodate molecules of this size.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MAF-23
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAF-23:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Gating flexibility)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Gating flexibility for molecular sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-23 lies between **3.200 Å** (adsorbed CO2) and **3.877 Å** (non-adsorbed methane). The MOF exhibits very precise molecular sieving.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of MAF-23's effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-23. The "Gating flexibility" mechanism observed for methane suggests that while the pores might adapt slightly, they are not large enough to accommodate molecules of this size.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAF-23:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Gating flexibility)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Gating flexibility for molecular sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-23 lies between **3.200 Å** (adsorbed CO2) and **3.877 Å** (non-adsorbed methane). The MOF exhibits very precise molecular sieving.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of MAF-23's effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-23. The "Gating flexibility" mechanism observed for methane suggests that while the pores might adapt slightly, they are not large enough to accommodate molecules of this size.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAF-23:

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of MAF-23's effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-23. The "Gating flexibility" mechanism observed for methane suggests that while the pores might adapt slightly, they are not large enough to accommodate molecules of this size.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
