MOF Name: MAF-42-sp
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAF-42-sp:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-42-sp lies between **4.047 Å and 4.175 Å**, i.e., it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to approximately 4.175 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~4.175 Å), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by MAF-42-sp due to size exclusion.
