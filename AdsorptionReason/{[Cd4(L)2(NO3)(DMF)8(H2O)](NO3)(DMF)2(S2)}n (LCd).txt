MOF Name: {[Cd4(L)2(NO3)(DMF)8(H2O)](NO3)(DMF)2(S2)}n (LCd)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOF `{[Cd4(L)2(NO3)(DMF)8(H2O)](NO3)(DMF)2(S2)}n (LCd)`:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed | Mechanism: Kinetic sieving, Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale.

Inferred effective pore size of LCd:
Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) via "Kinetic sieving" and "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," it is inferred that the MOF's pores are finely tuned and likely close to this size. The "Kinetic sieving" mechanism suggests a tight fit, implying that even slightly larger molecules may be excluded. While no explicit 'non-adsorbed' molecule is given for this MOF to establish an upper bound, the nature of the CO2 adsorption indicates a pore size around 3.200 Å or slightly above.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is adsorbed via a tight "Kinetic sieving" mechanism. Given this tight fit for CO2, it is highly improbable that a molecule nearly twice its intermediate size could be adsorbed by this MOF due to size exclusion.
