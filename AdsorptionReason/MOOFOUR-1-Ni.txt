MOF Name: MOOFOUR-1-Ni
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOOFOUR-1-Ni:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly stated as adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni in the provided data is 3.877 Å (for methane). No experimental data is provided for MOOFOUR-1-Ni indicating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 3.877 Å, nor is there data on molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which would define an upper limit for the pore size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any molecule known to be adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni (3.877 Å), and given that MOF adsorption is governed by size exclusion, it is reasonably inferred that isoprene will not be adsorbed as its size likely exceeds the effective pore size of MOOFOUR-1-Ni.

MOF Name: MOOFOUR-1-Ni
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOOFOUR-1-Ni:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly stated as adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni in the provided data is 3.877 Å (for methane). No experimental data is provided for MOOFOUR-1-Ni indicating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 3.877 Å, nor is there data on molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which would define an upper limit for the pore size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any molecule known to be adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni (3.877 Å), and given that MOF adsorption is governed by size exclusion, it is reasonably inferred that cis-2-pentene will not be adsorbed as its size likely exceeds the effective pore size of MOOFOUR-1-Ni.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOOFOUR-1-Ni:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly stated as adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni in the provided data is 3.877 Å (for methane). No experimental data is provided for MOOFOUR-1-Ni indicating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 3.877 Å, nor is there data on molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which would define an upper limit for the pore size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any molecule known to be adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni (3.877 Å), and given that MOF adsorption is governed by size exclusion, it is reasonably inferred that 1-pentene will not be adsorbed as its size likely exceeds the effective pore size of MOOFOUR-1-Ni.

- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly stated as adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni in the provided data is 3.877 Å (for methane). No experimental data is provided for MOOFOUR-1-Ni indicating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 3.877 Å, nor is there data on molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which would define an upper limit for the pore size.

- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any molecule known to be adsorbed by MOOFOUR-1-Ni (3.877 Å), and given that MOF adsorption is governed by size exclusion, it is reasonably inferred that trans-2-pentene will not be adsorbed as its size likely exceeds the effective pore size of MOOFOUR-1-Ni.
