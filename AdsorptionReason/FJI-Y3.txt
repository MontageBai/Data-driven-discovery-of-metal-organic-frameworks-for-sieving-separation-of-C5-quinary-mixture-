Here's the analysis for FJI-Y3 and the target guest molecules, based strictly on the provided data and criteria.

**Analysis of FJI-Y3's Inferred Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for FJI-Y3:

*   **butane:** 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.532 Å** | Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   **methane:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   **acetylene:** 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å** | Adsorbed (Chemical π-complexation, confirming passage)
*   **isobutane:** 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = **6.393 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Based on these observations:
*   The largest intermediate dimension for an adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion is 4.532 Å (butane).
*   The smallest intermediate dimension for a non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion is 6.393 Å (isobutane).

Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is greater than or equal to 4.532 Å and strictly less than 6.393 Å.
**Inferred effective pore size for FJI-Y3 ∈ [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).**
This means that any molecule with an intermediate dimension less than 6.393 Å should be able to pass through the pores. The separation mechanism noted as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale for n-C4H10/i-C4H10 separation" highlights a very precise cutoff for molecules of similar bulk dimensions but different shapes.

**MOF Name: FJI-Y3**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FJI-Y3:
- Adsorbed: butane (7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å), methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å)
- Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion): isobutane (6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å)
Inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is determined by the size exclusion behavior observed between butane and isobutane. The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.532 Å to adsorb, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range of [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the smallest non-adsorbed molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it falls within the inferred adsorption range based on size exclusion. Therefore, isoprene can be adsorbed by FJI-Y3.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FJI-Y3:
- Adsorbed: butane (7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å), methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å)
- Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion): isobutane (6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å)
Inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is determined by the size exclusion behavior observed between butane and isobutane. The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.532 Å to adsorb, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range of [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the smallest non-adsorbed molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it falls within the inferred adsorption range based on size exclusion. Therefore, cis-2-pentene can be adsorbed by FJI-Y3.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FJI-Y3:

- Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion): isobutane (6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å)
Inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is determined by the size exclusion behavior observed between butane and isobutane. The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.532 Å to adsorb, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range of [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the smallest non-adsorbed molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it falls within the inferred adsorption range based on size exclusion. Therefore, 1-pentene can be adsorbed by FJI-Y3.

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FJI-Y3:

- Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion): isobutane (6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å)
Inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is determined by the size exclusion behavior observed between butane and isobutane. The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.532 Å to adsorb, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range of [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the smallest non-adsorbed molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it falls within the inferred adsorption range based on size exclusion. Therefore, trans-2-pentene can be adsorbed by FJI-Y3.

**MOF Name: FJI-Y3**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for FJI-Y3:
- Adsorbed: butane (7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å), methane (3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å)
- Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion): isobutane (6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å)
Inferred effective pore size of FJI-Y3 is determined by the size exclusion behavior observed between butane and isobutane. The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.532 Å to adsorb, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å. Thus, the effective pore size is in the range of [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the smallest non-adsorbed molecule (isobutane, 6.393 Å), it falls within the inferred adsorption range based on size exclusion. In fact, it is even smaller than butane (4.532 Å), which is known to adsorb. Therefore, n-pentane can be adsorbed by FJI-Y3.
