MOF Name: UPC-66-a
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UPC-66-a:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorption: Conditional (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in hexagonal A and elliptical C type pores).
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorption: Yes (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in hexagonal A type pores).
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Adsorption: Conditional (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in elliptical C type pores).

Based on this data, the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule observed to be adsorbed by UPC-66-a (even conditionally) is 4.170 Å (ethane). The "Conditional" nature of ethane's adsorption, attributed to "self-adaptive pore engineering" and specific sites, suggests that 4.170 Å is at or very near the practical upper limit of the MOF's effective pore size. While the MOF can adapt its pores, this adaptivity is typically within a limited range and does not imply an indefinite increase in pore size to accommodate significantly larger molecules. There is no experimental data point explicitly stating a molecule fails to adsorb due to size exclusion, but the conditional adsorption of ethane effectively serves as an indicator of the maximum operable pore aperture under these conditions.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension observed to be adsorbed by UPC-66-a (4.170 Å), it is highly unlikely to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UPC-66-a:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorption: Conditional (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in hexagonal A and elliptical C type pores).

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension observed to be adsorbed by UPC-66-a (4.170 Å), it is highly unlikely to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: UPC-66-a
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UPC-66-a:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorption: Conditional (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in hexagonal A and elliptical C type pores).
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorption: Yes (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in hexagonal A type pores).
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Adsorption: Conditional (Self-adaptive pore engineering with structural response to guest molecules, Privileged adsorption sites in elliptical C type pores).

Based on this data, the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule observed to be adsorbed by UPC-66-a (even conditionally) is 4.170 Å (ethane). The "Conditional" nature of ethane's adsorption, attributed to "self-adaptive pore engineering" and specific sites, suggests that 4.170 Å is at or very near the practical upper limit of the MOF's effective pore size. While the MOF can adapt its pores, this adaptivity is typically within a limited range and does not imply an indefinite increase in pore size to accommodate significantly larger molecules. There is no experimental data point explicitly stating a molecule fails to adsorb due to size exclusion, but the conditional adsorption of ethane effectively serves as an indicator of the maximum operable pore aperture under these conditions.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension observed to be adsorbed by UPC-66-a (4.170 Å), it is highly unlikely to be adsorbed due to size exclusion. While the difference is relatively small, the "Conditional" status for ethane suggests that 4.170 Å is already a challenging fit, and a slightly larger molecule would likely exceed the adaptable pore's capacity.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
