**MOF Name: SD-65**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the provided experimental data for SD-65:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Based on this, the MOF SD-65's effective pore size is inferred to be **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) is excluded due to size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded due to size exclusion by SD-65, isoprene is geometrically smaller and should be able to pass through the effective pore opening of SD-65.

**MOF Name: SD-65**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the provided experimental data for SD-65:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Based on this, the MOF SD-65's effective pore size is inferred to be **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) is excluded due to size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded due to size exclusion by SD-65, cis-2-pentene is geometrically smaller and should be able to pass through the effective pore opening of SD-65.

**MOF Name: SD-65**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the provided experimental data for SD-65:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Based on this, the MOF SD-65's effective pore size is inferred to be **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) is excluded due to size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded due to size exclusion by SD-65, 1-pentene is geometrically smaller and should be able to pass through the effective pore opening of SD-65.

**MOF Name: SD-65**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the provided experimental data for SD-65:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Based on this, the MOF SD-65's effective pore size is inferred to be **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) is excluded due to size.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded due to size exclusion by SD-65, trans-2-pentene is geometrically smaller and should be able to pass through the effective pore opening of SD-65.

**MOF Name: SD-65**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the provided experimental data for SD-65:
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Based on this, the MOF SD-65's effective pore size is inferred to be **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane (intermediate dimension 6.393 Å) is excluded due to size.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded due to size exclusion by SD-65, n-pentane is geometrically smaller and should be able to pass through the effective pore opening of SD-65.
