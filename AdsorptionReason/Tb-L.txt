MOF Name: Tb-L

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Tb-L:**
From the experimental data for Tb-L:
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO2):** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed ("Yes")

The experimental data states that Carbon Dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed by Tb-L, and the mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". This indicates that the MOF's pores are at least 3.200 Å in effective diameter. However, no data is provided for any molecule being *excluded* due to size. Therefore, a definitive upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be strictly determined from the given information.

**Judgment Criteria with Limited Data:**
Given that the material exhibits "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" for CO2 adsorption (meaning its pores are precisely size-selective) and no larger molecules are shown to be adsorbed, it is reasonable to infer that molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å are likely to be excluded. This interpretation allows for a binary "Can Adsorb / Cannot Adsorb" prediction, as required by the task, even with incomplete pore mapping data.

MOF Name: Tb-L
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
-   **MOF's known adsorption:** Tb-L adsorbs Carbon Dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200 Å), which has an intermediate dimension of **3.200 Å**. The mechanism is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale".
-   **Inferred effective pore size:** Based on the adsorption of CO2 and the stated size exclusion mechanism, the effective pore size of Tb-L is inferred to be approximately around 3.200 Å or slightly larger.
-   **Target molecule dimensions:** Isoprene (7.746×6.093×3.963 Å) has an intermediate dimension of **6.093 Å**.
-   **Conclusion:** Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (CO2 at 3.200 Å), and the MOF exhibits size-exclusion behavior, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by Tb-L.
