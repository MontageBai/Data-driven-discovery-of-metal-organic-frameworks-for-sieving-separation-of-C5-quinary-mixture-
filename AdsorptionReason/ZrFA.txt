MOF Name: ZrFA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZrFA:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZrFA:
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (acetylene, carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene). This indicates that the effective pore size of ZrFA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å. Therefore, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of ZrFA's inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZrFA due to size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZrFA:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZrFA:
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (acetylene, carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene). This indicates that the effective pore size of ZrFA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å. Therefore, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of ZrFA's inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZrFA due to size exclusion.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZrFA:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZrFA:
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (acetylene, carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene). This indicates that the effective pore size of ZrFA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å. Therefore, the effective pore size is in the range [3.200 Å, 4.047 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of ZrFA's inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZrFA due to size exclusion.
