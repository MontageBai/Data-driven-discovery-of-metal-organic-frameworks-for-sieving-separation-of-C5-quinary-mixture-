MOF Name: Mg-MOF-74
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Mg-MOF-74:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Ordered dimensions: 3.200, 3.200, 5.198 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Ordered dimensions: 3.849, 3.877, 3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Mg-MOF-74: It allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size of Mg-MOF-74 is inferred to be in the range of **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Ordered dimensions: 3.963, 6.093, 7.746 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of Mg-MOF-74's effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Mg-MOF-74 based on size exclusion.
