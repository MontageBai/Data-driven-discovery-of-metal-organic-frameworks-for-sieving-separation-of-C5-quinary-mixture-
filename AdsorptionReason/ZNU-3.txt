MOF Name: ZNU-3
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZNU-3 at 298 K, 1 bar:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Selective gate opening for C2H2 adsorption)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion due to smaller pore aperture)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion due to smaller pore aperture)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion due to smaller pore aperture)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Gate opening pressure much higher for CO2 than C2H2)

Inferred effective pore size of ZNU-3 for adsorption at 298 K, 1 bar:
ZNU-3 adsorbs acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) via gate opening. However, it explicitly excludes methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å), ethylene (4.047 Å), and ethane (4.175 Å) due to "size exclusion". Therefore, the effective pore aperture, even with gate opening, is large enough for 3.200 Å but smaller than 3.877 Å.
Thus, the inferred effective pore size of ZNU-3 lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**. Any molecule with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger is expected to be excluded by size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZNU-3 due to size exclusion.
