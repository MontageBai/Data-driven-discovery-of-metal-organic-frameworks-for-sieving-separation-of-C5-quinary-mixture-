MOF Name: ATC-Cu

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size for ATC-Cu:**

*   **Experimental Data for ATC-Cu:**
    *   `ATC-Cu,methane,Yes,Preferential adsorption via adjacent open copper sites.,Size exclusion,298 K, 1 bar,Not Applicable`
*   **Methane Dimensions:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å
*   **Intermediate Dimension of Methane:** Sorting the dimensions (3.849, 3.877, 3.918), the intermediate dimension is **3.877 Å**.

**Inference:**
Methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) was adsorbed by ATC-Cu. The `Adsorption Type` is specified as "Size exclusion". This indicates that the MOF's pore structure is capable of allowing molecules of this size to pass, and its operational principle involves size discrimination.

Based strictly on the provided data, we have one adsorbed molecule (`methane` at 3.877 Å) and no molecules explicitly stated as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. Therefore, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be established directly from a "min_intermediate_nonadsorbed" value.

However, as a materials scientist, and given that "Size exclusion" is explicitly mentioned as the Adsorption Type for methane's passage, it is a reasonable inference that the MOF's pores are tuned around this size range. In the absence of data for larger molecules being adsorbed, and especially with a stated "Size exclusion" mechanism, it is predicted that molecules significantly larger than methane will be excluded. Thus, we will consider the effective pore size of ATC-Cu to be approximately **3.877 Å** for the purpose of size exclusion, meaning molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly greater than this are unlikely to be adsorbed.

**Evaluations for Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: ATC-Cu**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu is approximately **3.877 Å**. While no upper limit from non-adsorbed molecules is provided, the adsorption of methane via a "Size exclusion" mechanism suggests that molecules considerably larger than methane will likely be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: ATC-Cu**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu is approximately **3.877 Å**. While no upper limit from non-adsorbed molecules is provided, the adsorption of methane via a "Size exclusion" mechanism suggests that molecules considerably larger than methane will likely be excluded.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: ATC-Cu**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu is approximately **3.877 Å**. While no upper limit from non-adsorbed molecules is provided, the adsorption of methane via a "Size exclusion" mechanism suggests that molecules considerably larger than methane will likely be excluded.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu is approximately **3.877 Å**. While no upper limit from non-adsorbed molecules is provided, the adsorption of methane via a "Size exclusion" mechanism suggests that molecules considerably larger than methane will likely be excluded.

Inferred effective pore size of ATC-Cu is approximately **3.877 Å**. While no upper limit from non-adsorbed molecules is provided, the adsorption of methane via a "Size exclusion" mechanism suggests that molecules considerably larger than methane will likely be excluded.
