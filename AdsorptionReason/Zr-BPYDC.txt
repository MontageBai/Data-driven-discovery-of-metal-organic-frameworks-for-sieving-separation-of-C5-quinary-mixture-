MOF Name: Zr-BPYDC

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Zr-BPYDC:**

From the experimental data provided for Zr-BPYDC:
*   **propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = **4.354 Å** | Adsorbed: Yes
*   **propylene:** 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = **5.051 Å** | Adsorbed: No, Reason: "Preferential adsorption of C3H8"

Based on this data:
1.  Zr-BPYDC successfully adsorbs propane (intermediate dimension = 4.354 Å). This indicates that the MOF's pores are at least large enough to accommodate molecules of this size.
2.  Zr-BPYDC does *not* adsorb propylene (intermediate dimension = 5.051 Å). Crucially, the reason stated is "Preferential adsorption of C3H8", not "Size exclusion". This implies that while propylene *might* be able to physically enter the pores, its adsorption is kinetically hindered or outcompeted by propane under the experimental conditions. This suggests that the effective "adsorption window" of Zr-BPYDC is quite specific and acts as a kinetic sieving mechanism, effectively limiting practical adsorption of molecules larger than propane, even if not strictly size-excluded.

Therefore, for the purpose of effective adsorption under the given conditions, the inferred functional pore size of Zr-BPYDC allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to approximately **4.354 Å**, but effectively restricts or significantly hinders molecules at or above **5.051 Å**. This means molecules with intermediate dimensions between 4.354 Å and 5.051 Å may have a reduced likelihood or rate of adsorption compared to propane.

**Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: Zr-BPYDC**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Zr-BPYDC adsorbs propane (intermediate = 4.354 Å) but does not adsorb propylene (intermediate = 5.051 Å) due to preferential adsorption/kinetic sieving. This implies that the effective practical adsorption limit for this MOF is below 5.051 Å.
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) significantly exceeds this inferred effective adsorption limit (5.051 Å). Therefore, it is highly unlikely to be effectively adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC under similar conditions.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Zr-BPYDC adsorbs propane (intermediate = 4.354 Å) but does not adsorb propylene (intermediate = 5.051 Å) due to preferential adsorption/kinetic sieving. This implies that the effective practical adsorption limit for this MOF is below 5.051 Å.
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) exceeds this inferred effective adsorption limit (5.051 Å). Therefore, it is highly unlikely to be effectively adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC under similar conditions.

**MOF Name: Zr-BPYDC**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Zr-BPYDC adsorbs propane (intermediate = 4.354 Å) but does not adsorb propylene (intermediate = 5.051 Å) due to preferential adsorption/kinetic sieving. This implies that the effective practical adsorption limit for this MOF is below 5.051 Å.
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than propane but still *below* the 5.051 Å intermediate dimension of propylene, which was kinetically limited. Given it's within this range, and not explicitly larger than a molecule that was functionally excluded, it is predicted that 1-pentene *can* be adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC.

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Zr-BPYDC adsorbs propane (intermediate = 4.354 Å) but does not adsorb propylene (intermediate = 5.051 Å) due to preferential adsorption/kinetic sieving. This implies that the effective practical adsorption limit for this MOF is below 5.051 Å.
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is larger than propane but still *below* the 5.051 Å intermediate dimension of propylene, which was kinetically limited. Given it's within this range, and not explicitly larger than a molecule that was functionally excluded, it is predicted that trans-2-pentene *can* be adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC.

**MOF Name: Zr-BPYDC**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, Zr-BPYDC adsorbs propane (intermediate = 4.354 Å).
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is very close to and just slightly larger than propane's (4.354 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC. It is well within the inferred effective adsorption range of Zr-BPYDC. Therefore, it is predicted that n-pentane *can* be adsorbed by Zr-BPYDC.
