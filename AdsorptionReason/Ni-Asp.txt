MOF Name: Ni-Asp
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni-Asp:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni-Asp: Since both 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å) and 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate 6.545 Å) were explicitly stated as "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion," the MOF's effective pore size must be smaller than the smallest intermediate dimension of these excluded molecules. Therefore, the effective pore size of Ni-Asp is inferred to be **< 6.008 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Ni-Asp due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Ni-Asp
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni-Asp:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni-Asp: Based on the size exclusion of 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å), the effective pore size of Ni-Asp is inferred to be **< 6.008 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by Ni-Asp. No kinetic sieving information is available for similar sized molecules to suggest a tighter fit.

MOF Name: Ni-Asp
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni-Asp:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni-Asp: Based on the size exclusion of 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å), the effective pore size of Ni-Asp is inferred to be **< 6.008 Å**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by Ni-Asp. No kinetic sieving information is available for similar sized molecules to suggest a tighter fit.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni-Asp:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
*   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni-Asp: Based on the size exclusion of 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å), the effective pore size of Ni-Asp is inferred to be **< 6.008 Å**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by Ni-Asp. No kinetic sieving information is available for similar sized molecules to suggest a tighter fit.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by Ni-Asp. No kinetic sieving information is available for similar sized molecules to suggest a tighter fit.
