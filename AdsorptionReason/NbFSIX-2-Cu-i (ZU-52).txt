Here's the analysis for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) and the target guest molecules:

First, let's establish the inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) based on the provided experimental data and guest molecule probe sizes:

**Known Guest Molecule Probe Sizes (Intermediate Dimension):**
*   **1-butene:** 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = **4.583 Å**
*   **isobutene:** 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = **5.566 Å**

**Experimental Adsorption Data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):**
*   1-butene: Adsorbed (Yes)
*   isobutene: Not Adsorbed (No), due to Size exclusion

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):**
*   Since 1-butene (intermediate dimension 4.583 Å) is adsorbed, the pore must be at least 4.583 Å.
*   Since isobutene (intermediate dimension 5.566 Å) is *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, the pore must be smaller than 5.566 Å.
*   Therefore, the inferred effective pore size (P) of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) is in the range: **4.583 Å ≤ P < 5.566 Å**.

Now, let's evaluate each target guest molecule:

MOF Name: NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):
-   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = 4.583 Å | Adsorbed (via Gate-opening)
-   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.566 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) lies in the range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.566 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):
-   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = 4.583 Å | Adsorbed (via Gate-opening)
-   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.566 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) lies in the range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
-   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.566 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52)
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):
-   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = 4.583 Å | Adsorbed (via Gate-opening)
-   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.566 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) lies in the range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å). The observation of "Gate-opening phenomenon" for 1-butene suggests a dynamic pore aperture capable of accommodating molecules up to its intermediate dimension.

1-pentene Dimensions:
-   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å) and is smaller than the largest molecule excluded by size (isobutene), it is geometrically compatible and should be able to pass through the pore aperture.

MOF Name: NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52)
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):
-   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = 4.583 Å | Adsorbed (via Gate-opening)
-   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.566 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) lies in the range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å). The observation of "Gate-opening phenomenon" for 1-butene suggests a dynamic pore aperture capable of accommodating molecules up to its intermediate dimension.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
-   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å) and is smaller than the largest molecule excluded by size (isobutene), it is geometrically compatible and should be able to pass through the pore aperture.

MOF Name: NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52)
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52):
-   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 Å → Intermediate = 4.583 Å | Adsorbed (via Gate-opening)
-   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 Å → Intermediate = 5.566 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NbFSIX-2-Cu-i (ZU-52) lies in the range [4.583 Å, 5.566 Å). The MOF can adsorb 1-butene (intermediate dimension 4.583 Å).

n-pentane Dimensions:
-   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of 1-butene (4.583 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by the MOF (even with a gate-opening mechanism, implying the pore can at least reach this size), n-pentane should also be able to pass through and be adsorbed.
