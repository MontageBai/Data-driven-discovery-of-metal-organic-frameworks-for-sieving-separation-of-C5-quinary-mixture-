MOF Name: ELM-12
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ELM-12:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ELM-12:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.961 Å, but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size of ELM-12 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and strictly less than 5.051 Å.
Effective pore size ∈ [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ELM-12 due to size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ELM-12:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ELM-12:
The effective pore size of ELM-12 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and strictly less than 5.051 Å.
Effective pore size ∈ [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ELM-12 due to size exclusion.

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ELM-12:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ELM-12:
The effective pore size of ELM-12 is greater than or equal to 3.961 Å and strictly less than 5.051 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (5.051 Å) but greater than the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (3.961 Å), it falls within the inferred effective pore size range [3.961 Å, 5.051 Å). Based on geometric compatibility, it should be able to pass through the pores.
