MOF Name: DynaMOF-100
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Styrene: 9.542×6.849×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.849 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the provided data, DynaMOF-100 is shown to adsorb styrene, which has an intermediate dimension of 6.849 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size of DynaMOF-100 is at least 6.849 Å. There is no data available to suggest a smaller upper bound for the pore size due to size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of styrene (6.849 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by DynaMOF-100, it is predicted that isoprene can also be adsorbed by DynaMOF-100, assuming no other specific interactions or kinetic sieving effects prevent its passage that are not covered by the existing data.

Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Styrene: 9.542×6.849×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.849 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the provided data, DynaMOF-100 is shown to adsorb styrene, which has an intermediate dimension of 6.849 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size of DynaMOF-100 is at least 6.849 Å. There is no data available to suggest a smaller upper bound for the pore size due to size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
