Here's the analysis for CPO-27-Ni and the specified guest molecules, based strictly on the provided data and rules.

**Analysis of CPO-27-Ni Experimental Data:**

*   **Adsorbed Molecule:** 1-octene (12.648×4.729×4.980 Å)
    *   Sorted dimensions: 4.729, 4.980, 12.648 Å
    *   Intermediate dimension for 1-octene = **4.980 Å**
    *   Reason for adsorption: "Coordination bond with unsaturated metal center" (implies physical entry into the pore is possible).

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of CPO-27-Ni:**
Based on the adsorption of 1-octene (intermediate dimension 4.980 Å), the effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is inferred to be **at least 4.980 Å**.
There is no experimental data provided for molecules that were "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, therefore, an upper bound for the pore size based on size exclusion cannot be established from the given data.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

MOF Name: CPO-27-Ni
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPO-27-Ni:
- 1-octene: 12.648×4.729×4.980 Å → Intermediate = 4.980 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is at least **4.980 Å**. No upper bound for size exclusion is established from the provided data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed 1-octene (4.980 Å). However, since there is no experimental data indicating size exclusion for molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 4.980 Å, it cannot be definitively concluded that isoprene *cannot* be adsorbed. Given the absence of exclusionary evidence and the general property that pores can be larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension, it is predicted that isoprene **can be adsorbed** by CPO-27-Ni.

MOF Name: CPO-27-Ni
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPO-27-Ni:
- 1-octene: 12.648×4.729×4.980 Å → Intermediate = 4.980 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is at least **4.980 Å**. No upper bound for size exclusion is established from the provided data.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed 1-octene (4.980 Å). However, since there is no experimental data indicating size exclusion for molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 4.980 Å, it cannot be definitively concluded that cis-2-pentene *cannot* be adsorbed. Given the absence of exclusionary evidence and the general property that pores can be larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene **can be adsorbed** by CPO-27-Ni.

MOF Name: CPO-27-Ni
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPO-27-Ni:
- 1-octene: 12.648×4.729×4.980 Å → Intermediate = 4.980 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is at least **4.980 Å**. No upper bound for size exclusion is established from the provided data.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is marginally larger than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed 1-octene (4.980 Å). However, since there is no experimental data indicating size exclusion for molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 4.980 Å, it cannot be definitively concluded that 1-pentene *cannot* be adsorbed. Given the absence of exclusionary evidence and the general property that pores can be larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension, it is predicted that 1-pentene **can be adsorbed** by CPO-27-Ni.

MOF Name: CPO-27-Ni
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPO-27-Ni:
- 1-octene: 12.648×4.729×4.980 Å → Intermediate = 4.980 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is at least **4.980 Å**. No upper bound for size exclusion is established from the provided data.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed 1-octene (4.980 Å). Since CPO-27-Ni can adsorb a molecule with an intermediate dimension of 4.980 Å, it can also accommodate smaller molecules. Therefore, trans-2-pentene **can be adsorbed** by CPO-27-Ni.

MOF Name: CPO-27-Ni
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CPO-27-Ni:
- 1-octene: 12.648×4.729×4.980 Å → Intermediate = 4.980 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of CPO-27-Ni is at least **4.980 Å**. No upper bound for size exclusion is established from the provided data.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed 1-octene (4.980 Å). Since CPO-27-Ni can adsorb a molecule with an intermediate dimension of 4.980 Å, it can also accommodate smaller molecules. Therefore, n-pentane **can be adsorbed** by CPO-27-Ni.
