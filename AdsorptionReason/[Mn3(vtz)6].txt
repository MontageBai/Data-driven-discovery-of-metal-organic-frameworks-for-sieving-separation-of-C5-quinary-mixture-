MOF Name: [Mn3(vtz)6]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Mn3(vtz)6]:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Quadrupole-moment sieving and size exclusion)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Quadrupole-moment sieving and size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of [Mn3(vtz)6]:
The experimental data for [Mn3(vtz)6] indicates a highly selective pore. Acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed, suggesting the pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, carbon dioxide (also intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is *not* adsorbed, with "size exclusion" listed as part of the reason, in addition to "Quadrupole-moment sieving." This apparent contradiction (adsorbing one molecule of 3.200 Å but not another of the same intermediate size, with size exclusion mentioned) implies that the MOF's pore acts as a very tight and highly selective sieve, effectively having a functional cutoff very close to 3.200 Å. Even slight differences in molecular shape, flexibility, or specific interactions (like quadrupole moment) become critical for passage at this tight size window. Therefore, while capable of accommodating molecules of 3.200 Å (acetylene), the pore is effectively at its limit or highly discriminative at this size, leading to the exclusion of similarly sized molecules like CO2. This suggests that molecules significantly larger than 3.200 Å would likely be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size's functional cutoff (~3.200 Å), it is highly probable that it cannot be adsorbed by [Mn3(vtz)6] due to size exclusion.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
