MOF Name: [Mn(bdc)(dpe)]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Mn(bdc)(dpe)]:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, but geometrically able to pass)

Based on the provided experimental data, the MOF [Mn(bdc)(dpe)] has demonstrated adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 3.200 Å. No data is provided for larger molecules being explicitly rejected due to size exclusion, which would establish an upper bound for the pore size. However, the "Size exclusion" Adsorption Type for the adsorbed molecules implies that the pore size controls the access. Given the absence of experimental evidence for adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions larger than 3.200 Å, the effective pore size of [Mn(bdc)(dpe)] is pragmatically inferred to be approximately 3.200 Å, as it is the largest known adsorbed molecule.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of [Mn(bdc)(dpe)] (approximately 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF via a size exclusion mechanism.
