**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**

**Inferred MOF effective pore size:**
From the experimental data for Cu-WO4-TPA:
*   `hexane`: 10.359×4.607×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.607 Å** | Adsorbed
*   `2,3-dimethylbutane`: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = **6.170 Å** | Adsorbed
*   `2,2-dimethylbutane`: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = **6.545 Å** | Adsorbed

Based on the provided data, Cu-WO4-TPA is confirmed to adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to **6.545 Å** (from 2,2-dimethylbutane). No molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion in the given dataset for this MOF, so an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be inferred from this specific data. Therefore, the MOF's effective pore size is inferred to be **at least 6.545 Å**.

**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **isoprene Dimensions:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
The inferred effective pore size of Cu-WO4-TPA is at least 6.545 Å, as it adsorbed 2,2-dimethylbutane with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Cu-WO4-TPA based on size exclusion principles.

**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **cis-2-pentene Dimensions:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
The inferred effective pore size of Cu-WO4-TPA is at least 6.545 Å, as it adsorbed 2,2-dimethylbutane with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Cu-WO4-TPA based on size exclusion principles.

**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **1-pentene Dimensions:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
The inferred effective pore size of Cu-WO4-TPA is at least 6.545 Å, as it adsorbed 2,2-dimethylbutane with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Cu-WO4-TPA based on size exclusion principles.

**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **trans-2-pentene Dimensions:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Conclusion:
The inferred effective pore size of Cu-WO4-TPA is at least 6.545 Å, as it adsorbed 2,2-dimethylbutane with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Cu-WO4-TPA based on size exclusion principles.

**MOF Name: Cu-WO4-TPA**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **n-pentane Dimensions:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Conclusion:
The inferred effective pore size of Cu-WO4-TPA is at least 6.545 Å, as it adsorbed 2,2-dimethylbutane with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Cu-WO4-TPA based on size exclusion principles.
