MOF Name: Zn(BDC)(4,4′-Bipy)0.5
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn(BDC)(4,4′-Bipy)0.5:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Selective adsorption based on molecular geometry, Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn(BDC)(4,4′-Bipy)0.5:
The fact that methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) is adsorbed and the mechanism is stated as "Size exclusion" for its selectivity strongly suggests that the MOF's pore size is approximately tailored to allow molecules of this size or smaller, while excluding larger ones. Thus, the effective pore size is inferred to be around 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (approximately 3.877 Å) based on methane adsorption via size exclusion, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by Zn(BDC)(4,4′-Bipy)0.5.
