MOF Name: Ca-trimesate (bnn-1-Ca-H2O)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ca-trimesate (bnn-1-Ca-H2O):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ca-trimesate (bnn-1-Ca-H2O):
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å but not 3.877 Å. This suggests that the effective pore size is large enough to accommodate molecules up to 3.200 Å, but too small for molecules of 3.877 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and strictly less than 3.877 Å. For practical purposes in sieving, molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger will be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the smallest molecule excluded (methane at 3.877 Å), it is highly likely to be excluded by size.
