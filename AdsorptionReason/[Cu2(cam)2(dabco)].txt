**MOF Name: [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]**

**Detailed Reasoning for all predictions:**

From the provided experimental data for `[Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]`, we first extract the intermediate dimensions of the known guest molecules and their adsorption behavior:

*   **Adsorbed (Yes):**
    *   `methane`: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å**
    *   `ethane`: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = **4.175 Å**
    *   `propane`: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = **4.354 Å**
    *   The largest intermediate dimension for molecules that *can* adsorb is **4.354 Å** (propane).

*   **Not Adsorbed (No) or Conditional (due to Size exclusion):**
    *   `isobutane`: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = **6.393 Å** (Conditional, Size exclusion)
    *   `3,3-dimethylpentane`: 7.269×6.397×5.724 → Intermediate = **6.397 Å** (No, Size exclusion)
    *   `cyclohexane`: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = **6.949 Å** (No, Size exclusion)
    *   The smallest intermediate dimension for molecules explicitly stated as "No" or "Conditional (due to Size exclusion)" is **6.393 Å** (isobutane). The "Conditional" status for isobutane, attributed to "Size exclusion", strongly suggests that molecules of this size (6.393 Å) or larger cannot be effectively adsorbed under the given conditions.

**Inferred effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]:**

Based on the experimental data, `[Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]` can reliably adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to **4.354 Å** (propane). Molecules with intermediate dimensions of **6.393 Å** or larger are either conditionally adsorbed or not adsorbed at all due to size exclusion. Therefore, for practical adsorption under standard conditions, the effective pore size is approximately **4.354 Å**. Molecules larger than this threshold are unlikely to be adsorbed effectively.

**MOF Name: [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- The MOF's known adsorbed molecule with the largest intermediate dimension is propane (4.354 Å).
- The MOF's known non-adsorbed/conditional molecules due to size exclusion start from isobutane (6.393 Å).
- Inferred effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)] is approximately **4.354 Å** for reliable adsorption.
- Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
- Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size for reliable adsorption (4.354 Å) and close to the size of molecules known to be excluded (e.g., isobutane at 6.393 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)].

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- The MOF's known adsorbed molecule with the largest intermediate dimension is propane (4.354 Å).
- The MOF's known non-adsorbed/conditional molecules due to size exclusion start from isobutane (6.393 Å).
- Inferred effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)] is approximately **4.354 Å** for reliable adsorption.
- cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
- Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size for reliable adsorption (4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)].

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- The MOF's known adsorbed molecule with the largest intermediate dimension is propane (4.354 Å).
- The MOF's known non-adsorbed/conditional molecules due to size exclusion start from isobutane (6.393 Å).
- Inferred effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)] is approximately **4.354 Å** for reliable adsorption.
- 1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
- Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size for reliable adsorption (4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)].

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- The MOF's known adsorbed molecule with the largest intermediate dimension is propane (4.354 Å).
- The MOF's known non-adsorbed/conditional molecules due to size exclusion start from isobutane (6.393 Å).

- Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size for reliable adsorption (4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)].

**MOF Name: [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)]**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- The MOF's known adsorbed molecule with the largest intermediate dimension is propane (4.354 Å).
- The MOF's known non-adsorbed/conditional molecules due to size exclusion start from isobutane (6.393 Å).
- Inferred effective pore size of [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)] is approximately **4.354 Å** for reliable adsorption.
- n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**
- Conclusion: Although n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is only marginally larger than the largest reliably adsorbed molecule (propane, 4.354 Å), it exceeds the established threshold for effective adsorption. Given the strict size exclusion behavior observed for molecules even slightly larger than propane, n-pentane cannot be effectively adsorbed by [Cu2(cam)2(dabco)].
