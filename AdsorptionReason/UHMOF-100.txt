MOF Name: UHMOF-100
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Toluene: 8.117×6.501×3.750 Å → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Hydrophobic interactions)

Based on the adsorption of toluene, the MOF's effective pore size is inferred to be at least 6.501 Å to accommodate this molecule. As no experimental data for non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion) is provided, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be determined.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of the largest adsorbed molecule (toluene, 6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible with the MOF's pores. Therefore, based on size compatibility as per the problem's rules, it can be adsorbed by UHMOF-100.
