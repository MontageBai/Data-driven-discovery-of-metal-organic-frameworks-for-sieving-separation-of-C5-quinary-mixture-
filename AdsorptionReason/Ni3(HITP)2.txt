MOF Name: Ni3(HITP)2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ammonia: 3.826×3.610×3.060 → Intermediate = 3.610 Å | Not Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Ni3(HITP)2 is less than **3.610 Å**, based on the non-adsorption of ammonia.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 3.610 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Ni3(HITP)2.

MOF Name: Ni3(HITP)2
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ammonia: 3.826×3.610×3.060 → Intermediate = 3.610 Å | Not Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Ni3(HITP)2 is less than **3.610 Å**, based on the non-adsorption of ammonia.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of the effective pore size (< 3.610 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Ni3(HITP)2.
