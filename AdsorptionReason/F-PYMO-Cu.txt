MOF Name: F-PYMO-Cu
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for F-PYMO-Cu:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of F-PYMO-Cu allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with intermediate dimensions of 4.047 Å and 4.170 Å due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å and less than 4.047 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by F-PYMO-Cu. There is no evidence of kinetic sieving for similar-sized molecules, only strict size exclusion.
