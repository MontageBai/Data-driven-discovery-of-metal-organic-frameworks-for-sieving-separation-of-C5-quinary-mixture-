MOF Name: Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4:
The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is Ethane (4.175 Å).
The smallest intermediate dimension of a non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion is Propane (4.354 Å).
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4 lies in the range **[4.175 Å, 4.354 Å)**. This means molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 4.354 Å are unlikely to pass due to size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.354 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is slightly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.354 Å), and propane (4.354 Å) was already identified as being excluded by size, n-pentane cannot be adsorbed by Ni(4-DPDS)2CrO4 due to size exclusion.
