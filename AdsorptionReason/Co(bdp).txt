MOF Name: Co(bdp)

**Analysis of Co(bdp) Experimental Data for Pore Size Inference:**

The experimental data for Co(bdp) indicates a dynamic pore behavior ("Pore-opening flexibility") but also clear size exclusion limits under certain conditions, particularly when CO2 is present and templating the material.

1.  **Adsorbed Molecule (due to size exclusion):**
    *   **carbon_dioxide**: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å.
        *   Intermediate Dimension: 3.200 Å.
        *   Adsorbed (Yes) because of "Reversible CO2 templating leading to near-perfect CO2 selectivity." and noted as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale." This indicates that even with templating, CO2 can pass.

2.  **Non-Adsorbed Molecule (due to size exclusion):**
    *   **methane**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å.
        *   To find the intermediate dimension, we sort the values: 3.849, 3.877, 3.918.
        *   Intermediate Dimension: 3.877 Å.
        *   Not Adsorbed (No) explicitly stated as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" when tested in a CO2:CH4 mixture, implying that in the CO2-templated state, methane is excluded. Another entry for methane also states "Conditional" adsorption due to "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", further supporting that methane can be excluded by size.

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Co(bdp):**
Based on these size exclusion data points, the effective pore size of Co(bdp) under conditions where size exclusion is observed (e.g., CO2 templating) is:
*   Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å for CO2).
*   Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (3.877 Å for methane).

Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of Co(bdp) is in the range **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)** when size exclusion is the dominant mechanism.

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **isoprene Dimensions:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å.
    *   To find the intermediate dimension, we sort the values: 3.963, 6.093, 7.746.
    *   Intermediate Dimension: 6.093 Å.
*   **Conclusion:** The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of Co(bdp)'s inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å). Thus, isoprene is expected to be excluded by size.
