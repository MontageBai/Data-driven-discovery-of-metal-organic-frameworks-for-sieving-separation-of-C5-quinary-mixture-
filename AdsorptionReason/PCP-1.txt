**Thinking Steps and Judgment Criteria Applied:**

1.  **Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size for PCP-1:**
    *   **Adsorbed Molecules:**
        *   Carbon dioxide (CO2): Dimensions = 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å. Intermediate dimension = 3.200 Å. Adsorbed.
    *   **Non-Adsorbed Molecules (due to size exclusion):** None explicitly provided in the data.
    *   **Inference:** Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å), the MOF's effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. The experimental data states the MOF exhibits "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". This implies that the pore aperture is well-defined and highly selective. In the absence of data for non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion, and considering the mechanism, it is inferred that the effective pore aperture is close to the size of the largest adsorbed molecule (3.200 Å), making it highly restrictive for molecules significantly larger than this.

2.  **Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**
    *   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å. Intermediate dimension = 6.093 Å.
    *   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å. Intermediate dimension = 5.572 Å.
    *   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å. Intermediate dimension = 4.995 Å.
    *   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å. Intermediate dimension = 4.733 Å.
    *   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å. Intermediate dimension = 4.364 Å.

3.  **Comprehensive Judgment:**
    The inferred effective pore size of PCP-1 is approximately around 3.200 Å, as it selectively adsorbs CO2 (intermediate 3.200 Å) and operates via "size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". All target molecules (isoprene, cis-2-pentene, 1-pentene, trans-2-pentene, n-pentane) have intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 3.200 Å (ranging from 4.364 Å to 6.093 Å). This large difference in size, coupled with the MOF's selective pore nature based on size exclusion, suggests that these larger molecules will be excluded.

MOF Name: PCP-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- No molecules are reported as non-adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Inferred effective pore size of PCP-1 is at least 3.200 Å. However, the MOF's operational mechanism is stated as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," and only CO2 (3.200 Å) is confirmed to be adsorbed. This suggests a tight pore aperture highly selective for small molecules.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest known adsorbed molecule (CO2, 3.200 Å), and the MOF operates by sub-nanometer scale size exclusion, it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by PCP-1.
