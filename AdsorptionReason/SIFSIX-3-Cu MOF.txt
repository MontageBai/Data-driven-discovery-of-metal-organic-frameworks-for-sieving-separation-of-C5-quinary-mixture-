MOF Name: SIFSIX-3-Cu MOF

**Inferred Effective Pore Size:**
From the experimental data for SIFSIX-3-Cu MOF, it is reported to adsorb carbon dioxide (CO2).
*   Carbon dioxide dimensions: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å. The intermediate dimension for CO2 is 3.200 Å.
*   The reason given for CO2 adsorption is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". This indicates that the MOF's pores are precisely dimensioned to allow molecules of CO2's size, effectively excluding larger molecules. While specific "No" adsorption data for molecules excluded by size is not provided for SIFSIX-3-Cu MOF, the description "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" implies a highly selective pore aperture. As seen in the NTU-67 example, a small difference (from 3.200 Å for acetylene to 4.047 Å for ethylene) was sufficient for size exclusion to occur. Therefore, it can be inferred that the effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Cu MOF is likely very close to 3.200 Å.
