MOF Name: fum-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for fum-fcu-MOF:
- Butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å | Adsorbed
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of fum-fcu-MOF is larger than or equal to 4.532 Å (as butane is adsorbed) and less than 6.393 Å (as isobutane is not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of fum-fcu-MOF (4.532 Å ≤ 6.093 Å < 6.393 Å), it can be adsorbed.

MOF Name: fum-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for fum-fcu-MOF:
- Butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å | Adsorbed
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of fum-fcu-MOF is larger than or equal to 4.532 Å (as butane is adsorbed) and less than 6.393 Å (as isobutane is not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of fum-fcu-MOF (4.532 Å ≤ 5.572 Å < 6.393 Å), it can be adsorbed.

MOF Name: fum-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for fum-fcu-MOF:
- Butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å | Adsorbed
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of fum-fcu-MOF is larger than or equal to 4.532 Å (as butane is adsorbed) and less than 6.393 Å (as isobutane is not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of fum-fcu-MOF (4.532 Å ≤ 4.995 Å < 6.393 Å), it can be adsorbed.

MOF Name: fum-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for fum-fcu-MOF:
- Butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å | Adsorbed
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of fum-fcu-MOF is larger than or equal to 4.532 Å (as butane is adsorbed) and less than 6.393 Å (as isobutane is not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of fum-fcu-MOF (4.532 Å ≤ 4.733 Å < 6.393 Å), it can be adsorbed.

MOF Name: fum-fcu-MOF
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for fum-fcu-MOF:
- Butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.532 Å | Adsorbed
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of fum-fcu-MOF is larger than or equal to 4.532 Å (as butane is adsorbed) and less than 6.393 Å (as isobutane is not adsorbed due to size exclusion). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [4.532 Å, 6.393 Å).

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of butane (4.532 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by fum-fcu-MOF, n-pentane is expected to pass through the pores. Therefore, it can be adsorbed.
