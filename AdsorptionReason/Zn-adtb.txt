MOF Name: Zn-adtb

To determine the adsorption capability, we first infer the effective pore size of Zn-adtb from the provided experimental data:

*   **3-methylpentane**: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å -> Intermediate = **6.008 Å**.
    *   Experimental data: "Conditional (see Additional Info)", "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", "Kinetic separation". This implies that 3-methylpentane can be adsorbed, but with significant kinetic limitations and a tight fit, indicating it's at the upper limit of the pore size for adsorption.
*   **2,3-dimethylbutane**: 7.778×6.170×5.399 Å -> Intermediate = **6.170 Å**.
    *   Experimental data: "No", "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", "Molecular sieving". This clearly indicates that 2,3-dimethylbutane is too large to enter the pores of Zn-adtb, setting an upper hard limit for the pore size.

**Inferred effective pore size of Zn-adtb:**
Based on these two data points, the effective pore size of Zn-adtb is inferred to be:
*   Greater than or equal to **6.008 Å** (since 3-methylpentane can pass conditionally).
*   Less than **6.170 Å** (since 2,3-dimethylbutane cannot pass).
Therefore, the effective pore size window is approximately **6.008 Å ≤ Pore Size < 6.170 Å**.

Now, let's evaluate each target guest molecule:

MOF Name: Zn-adtb
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = **6.008 Å** | Adsorbed (Conditional, Kinetic separation)
*   2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = **6.170 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-adtb is approximately **6.008 Å** (allowing conditional, kinetically-controlled passage) but strictly less than **6.170 Å** (preventing passage by molecular sieving).

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than that of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which is already only conditionally adsorbed due to kinetic separation and size exclusion at a sub-nanometer scale. Furthermore, it is very close to the hard cut-off limit of 2,3-dimethylbutane (6.170 Å) which is fully excluded by molecular sieving. Given the tight fit and kinetic limitations for the slightly smaller 3-methylpentane, isoprene, being larger, is highly likely to face even more severe kinetic barriers or be completely excluded by size. Therefore, under standard conditions, isoprene is predicted to not be adsorbed.

MOF Name: Zn-adtb
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = **6.008 Å** | Adsorbed (Conditional, Kinetic separation)
*   2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = **6.170 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Molecular sieving)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-adtb allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least **6.008 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than that of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which can be conditionally adsorbed, cis-2-pentene is expected to be adsorbed by Zn-adtb.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly smaller than that of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which can be conditionally adsorbed, trans-2-pentene is expected to be adsorbed by Zn-adtb.
