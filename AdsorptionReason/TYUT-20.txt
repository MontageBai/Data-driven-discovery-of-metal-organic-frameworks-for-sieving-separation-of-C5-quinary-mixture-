Based strictly on the provided experimental data and molecular size information, here is the determination for each MOF-guest molecule combination:

MOF Name: TYUT-20
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-20:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed
- The stated reason for non-adsorption of oxygen is "Repulsion due to linear shape" and "spheroidal shape-matched interactions," which indicates a kinetic sieving or shape-selective adsorption mechanism, rather than a definitive size exclusion limit for the pore. This means the MOF's effective pore size range *cannot be strictly inferred* based on size exclusion from the provided data, as no molecules are listed as "Adsorbed" and the non-adsorbed molecule (oxygen) is not rejected due to being too large for the pore.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since the MOF's size exclusion pore limits cannot be inferred from the given data, a definitive "Can Adsorb" prediction based on size cannot be made. Isoprene is a branched molecule, so the "Repulsion due to linear shape" observed for oxygen may not directly apply. However, in the absence of any information regarding molecules that *are* adsorbed by TYUT-20, and considering isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of oxygen (2.860 Å), it cannot be determined that it will pass. Without positive evidence for adsorption based on the provided data and inference rules, the most conservative prediction is that it cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: TYUT-20
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-20:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed
- The stated reason for non-adsorption of oxygen is "Repulsion due to linear shape" and "spheroidal shape-matched interactions," which indicates a kinetic sieving or shape-selective adsorption mechanism, rather than a definitive size exclusion limit for the pore. This means the MOF's effective pore size range *cannot be strictly inferred* based on size exclusion from the provided data, as no molecules are listed as "Adsorbed" and the non-adsorbed molecule (oxygen) is not rejected due to being too large for the pore.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since the MOF's size exclusion pore limits cannot be inferred from the given data, a definitive "Can Adsorb" prediction based on size cannot be made. cis-2-pentene is a non-linear molecule, so the "Repulsion due to linear shape" observed for oxygen may not directly apply. However, in the absence of any information regarding molecules that *are* adsorbed by TYUT-20, and considering cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than that of oxygen (2.860 Å), it cannot be determined that it will pass. Without positive evidence for adsorption based on the provided data and inference rules, the most conservative prediction is that it cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: TYUT-20
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-20:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed
- The stated reason for non-adsorption of oxygen is "Repulsion due to linear shape" and "spheroidal shape-matched interactions," which indicates a kinetic sieving or shape-selective adsorption mechanism, rather than a definitive size exclusion limit for the pore. This means the MOF's effective pore size range *cannot be strictly inferred* based on size exclusion from the provided data, as no molecules are listed as "Adsorbed" and the non-adsorbed molecule (oxygen) is not rejected due to being too large for the pore.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since the MOF's size exclusion pore limits cannot be inferred from the given data, a definitive "Can Adsorb" prediction based on size cannot be made. 1-pentene is a non-linear molecule (due to the double bond), so the "Repulsion due to linear shape" observed for oxygen may not directly apply. However, in the absence of any information regarding molecules that *are* adsorbed by TYUT-20, and considering 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than that of oxygen (2.860 Å), it cannot be determined that it will pass. Without positive evidence for adsorption based on the provided data and inference rules, the most conservative prediction is that it cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: TYUT-20
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-20:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed
- The stated reason for non-adsorption of oxygen is "Repulsion due to linear shape" and "spheroidal shape-matched interactions," which indicates a kinetic sieving or shape-selective adsorption mechanism, rather than a definitive size exclusion limit for the pore. This means the MOF's effective pore size range *cannot be strictly inferred* based on size exclusion from the provided data, as no molecules are listed as "Adsorbed" and the non-adsorbed molecule (oxygen) is not rejected due to being too large for the pore.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since the MOF's size exclusion pore limits cannot be inferred from the given data, a definitive "Can Adsorb" prediction based on size cannot be made. trans-2-pentene is a non-linear molecule, so the "Repulsion due to linear shape" observed for oxygen may not directly apply. However, in the absence of any information regarding molecules that *are* adsorbed by TYUT-20, and considering trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than that of oxygen (2.860 Å), it cannot be determined that it will pass. Without positive evidence for adsorption based on the provided data and inference rules, the most conservative prediction is that it cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: TYUT-20
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-20:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed
- The stated reason for non-adsorption of oxygen is "Repulsion due to linear shape" and "spheroidal shape-matched interactions." This indicates that TYUT-20 exhibits kinetic sieving behavior, actively disfavoring linear molecules. The MOF's effective pore size range based on size exclusion cannot be strictly inferred from this data, as the non-adsorption is due to shape, not necessarily a hard size cutoff.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane is a linear alkane. Given that oxygen (a smaller linear molecule with an intermediate dimension of 2.860 Å) is specifically not adsorbed by TYUT-20 due to "Repulsion due to linear shape," it is highly probable that n-pentane, being a larger linear molecule, would also be repelled or not adsorbed by TYUT-20 due to this established kinetic sieving mechanism, possibly combined with size effects as it's significantly larger than O2.
