MOF Name: hww + N599 + N320 + E50 + E51
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Enhanced binding through multiple node interactions, not explicitly due to size exclusion or kinetic sieving indicating a pore limit).

From the experimental data, the MOF is shown to adsorb carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension: 3.200 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size of hww + N599 + N320 + E50 + E51 is at least 3.200 Å. However, there is no experimental data provided for any molecule that was *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion or kinetic sieving. Consequently, an upper limit for the effective pore size of this MOF cannot be strictly inferred from the provided information.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed. While a precise upper limit for the pore size cannot be determined from the given data, MOFs are typically highly selective with well-defined pore apertures. Given the substantial difference in size, and the absence of any larger adsorbed molecules in the provided data, it is highly probable that isoprene would be sterically excluded by the MOF pores. Therefore, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed.
