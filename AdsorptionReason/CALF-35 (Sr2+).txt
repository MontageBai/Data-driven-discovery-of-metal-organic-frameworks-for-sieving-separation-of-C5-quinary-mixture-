MOF Name: CALF-35 (Sr2+)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CALF-35 (Sr2+):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon Dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 4.170 Å (Ethane). No molecules are reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the effective pore size of CALF-35 (Sr2+) is inferred to be at least **4.170 Å**. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, the pores are expected to be highly selective, and larger molecules are likely excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (Ethane, 4.170 Å). A difference of 1.923 Å is substantial in the context of sub-nanometer scale size exclusion. Thus, it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by CALF-35 (Sr2+).

- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon Dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is only slightly larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (Ethane, 4.170 Å), with a difference of 0.194 Å. This small difference suggests that n-pentane might still pass through the pores, possibly via a tight fit or kinetic sieving, consistent with "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" where very small differences in molecular size can determine adsorption. Thus, it is plausible that n-pentane can be adsorbed by CALF-35 (Sr2+).
