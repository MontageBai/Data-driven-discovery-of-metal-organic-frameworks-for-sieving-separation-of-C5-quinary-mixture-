MOF Name: Fe2(dobdc)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Fe2(dobdc):
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving observed)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Fe2(dobdc):
The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) to pass, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.175 Å (ethane) due to size exclusion. This indicates a very narrow pore aperture. The inferred effective pore size of Fe2(dobdc) is thus between **4.047 Å** and **4.175 Å**, approximately.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of Fe2(dobdc)'s effective pore size (~4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Fe2(dobdc) due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Fe2(dobdc)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Fe2(dobdc):
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving observed)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Fe2(dobdc):
The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) to pass, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.175 Å (ethane) due to size exclusion. This indicates a very narrow pore aperture. The inferred effective pore size of Fe2(dobdc) is thus between **4.047 Å** and **4.175 Å**, approximately.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of Fe2(dobdc)'s effective pore size (~4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Fe2(dobdc) due to size exclusion.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Fe2(dobdc):
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving observed)

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of Fe2(dobdc)'s effective pore size (~4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Fe2(dobdc) due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of Fe2(dobdc)'s effective pore size (~4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Fe2(dobdc) due to size exclusion.
