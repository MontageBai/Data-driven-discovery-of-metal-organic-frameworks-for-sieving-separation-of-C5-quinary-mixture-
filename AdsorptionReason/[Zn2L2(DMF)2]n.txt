MOF Name: [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed (due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, among other interactions)
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n lies in the range:
Effective pore size ∈ [6.762 Å, 6.949 Å)
This means molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.762 Å can pass, but those with 6.949 Å cannot.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n, it is predicted to be able to pass through the MOF's pores.

MOF Name: [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed (due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, among other interactions)

Inferred effective pore size of [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n lies in the range:
Effective pore size ∈ [6.762 Å, 6.949 Å)
This means molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.762 Å can pass, but those with 6.949 Å cannot.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n, it is predicted to be able to pass through the MOF's pores.

Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed (due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, among other interactions)
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n lies in the range:
Effective pore size ∈ [6.762 Å, 6.949 Å)
This means molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.762 Å can pass, but those with 6.949 Å cannot.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n, it is predicted to be able to pass through the MOF's pores.

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n:

This means molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.762 Å can pass, but those with 6.949 Å cannot.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by [Zn2L2(DMF)2]n, it is predicted to be able to pass through the MOF's pores.
