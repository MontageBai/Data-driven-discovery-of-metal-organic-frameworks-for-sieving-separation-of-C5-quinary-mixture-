MOF Name: SIFSIX-6-Cd-i
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-6-Cd-i:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the provided data, the largest molecule adsorbed by SIFSIX-6-Cd-i has an intermediate dimension of 4.175 Å (ethane). No molecules were reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-6-Cd-i is determined to be at least 4.175 Å. The upper bound of the pore size cannot be inferred from the given data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest adsorbed molecule (ethane, 4.175 Å) but there is no upper size limit established by non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion, it is predicted that SIFSIX-6-Cd-i can adsorb isoprene. The MOF's pore size is at least 4.175 Å, and without data showing a size exclusion cutoff below 6.093 Å, adsorption is anticipated based on the current information.

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest adsorbed molecule (ethane, 4.175 Å) but there is no upper size limit established by non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion, it is predicted that SIFSIX-6-Cd-i can adsorb cis-2-pentene. The MOF's pore size is at least 4.175 Å, and without data showing a size exclusion cutoff below 5.572 Å, adsorption is anticipated based on the current information.
