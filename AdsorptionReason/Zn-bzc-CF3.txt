To determine whether Zn-bzc-CF3 can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we first infer the MOF’s effective pore size based on the provided experimental data.

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size for Zn-bzc-CF3:**

*   **Non-adsorbed (No) molecules due to size exclusion:**
    *   **Perfluoropropane:** 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate dimension = **5.147 Å**. This molecule was **Not Adsorbed** due to size exclusion.

*   From this single data point, we infer that the effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 must be **less than 5.147 Å**.
*   There is no experimental data indicating which molecules *can* be adsorbed. Therefore, we cannot establish a lower bound for the pore size. We only know its upper limit based on exclusion.

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

We will compare the intermediate dimension of each target molecule to the inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 (< 5.147 Å).

**MOF Name: Zn-bzc-CF3**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Perfluoropropane: 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate = 5.147 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 is less than **5.147 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (less than 5.147 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-bzc-CF3 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: Zn-bzc-CF3**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Perfluoropropane: 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate = 5.147 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 is less than **5.147 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is greater than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (less than 5.147 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-bzc-CF3 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: Zn-bzc-CF3**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Perfluoropropane: 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate = 5.147 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 is less than **5.147 Å**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**

Conclusion:
While 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than perfluoropropane's (5.147 Å), which was excluded, we lack experimental data on any adsorbed molecules. Therefore, we cannot establish a lower bound for the MOF's pore size. Without a confirmed 'Yes' data point to indicate the actual pore size is large enough, and based solely on the provided information, we cannot definitively conclude that 1-pentene *can* be adsorbed. Thus, we cannot confirm adsorption.

**MOF Name: Zn-bzc-CF3**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Perfluoropropane: 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate = 5.147 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 is less than **5.147 Å**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**

Conclusion:
While trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than perfluoropropane's (5.147 Å), which was excluded, we lack experimental data on any adsorbed molecules. Therefore, we cannot establish a lower bound for the MOF's pore size. Without a confirmed 'Yes' data point to indicate the actual pore size is large enough, and based solely on the provided information, we cannot definitively conclude that trans-2-pentene *can* be adsorbed. Thus, we cannot confirm adsorption.

**MOF Name: Zn-bzc-CF3**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Perfluoropropane: 7.468×5.147×4.967 → Intermediate = 5.147 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-bzc-CF3 is less than **5.147 Å**.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

Conclusion:
While n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than perfluoropropane's (5.147 Å), which was excluded, we lack experimental data on any adsorbed molecules. Therefore, we cannot establish a lower bound for the MOF's pore size. Without a confirmed 'Yes' data point to indicate the actual pore size is large enough, and based solely on the provided information, we cannot definitively conclude that n-pentane *can* be adsorbed. Thus, we cannot confirm adsorption.
