Here's the analysis for Co-gallate MOF based on the provided data:

**Inferred Effective Pore Size and Selectivity Mechanism for Co-gallate MOF:**

From experimental data for Co-gallate MOF:
*   **Adsorbed (Yes):**
    *   **ethylene**: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = **4.047 Å**. (Mechanism: Size-compatible cross-section)
    *   **propylene**: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = **5.051 Å**. (Mechanism: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, but adsorption occurred)
*   **Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion):**
    *   **ethane**: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = **4.175 Å**. (Mechanism: Size exclusion)
    *   **propane**: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = **4.354 Å**. (Mechanism: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

**Analysis of MOF Behavior:**
The Co-gallate MOF exhibits clear **shape-selective adsorption** or **kinetic sieving**. It can adsorb alkenes (ethylene, propylene) with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å. However, it *cannot* adsorb alkanes (ethane, propane) even though their intermediate dimensions (4.175 Å and 4.354 Å, respectively) are smaller than that of adsorbed propylene (5.051 Å). This indicates a preference for unsaturated molecules (alkenes) over saturated ones (alkanes) due to specific interactions or pore geometry that restricts the passage of linear alkanes more effectively.

Therefore, the judgment criteria will be based on both the intermediate dimension and the molecular type (alkene vs. alkane).

**Evaluation for Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: Co-gallate MOF**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   **MOF's known behavior**: The Co-gallate MOF adsorbs alkenes up to an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene). It rejects alkanes with intermediate dimensions of 4.175 Å (ethane) and 4.354 Å (propane).
*   **Target molecule dimensions**: isoprene (7.746×6.093×3.963 Å) → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**.
*   **Conclusion**: Although isoprene is an alkene, its intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å). Based on a general size exclusion principle, it is too large to enter the pores.

**MOF Name: Co-gallate MOF**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   **MOF's known behavior**: The Co-gallate MOF adsorbs alkenes up to an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene).
*   **Target molecule dimensions**: cis-2-pentene (8.067×5.572×5.136 Å) → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**.
*   **Conclusion**: Although cis-2-pentene is an alkene, its intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å). This suggests it is likely too large for the pores, despite the MOF's general preference for alkenes.

**MOF Name: Co-gallate MOF**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   **MOF's known behavior**: The Co-gallate MOF adsorbs alkenes (ethylene 4.047 Å, propylene 5.051 Å) but rejects alkanes (ethane 4.175 Å, propane 4.354 Å). This demonstrates a strong shape-selective/kinetic sieving effect favoring alkenes.
*   **Target molecule dimensions**: 1-pentene (8.847×4.995×4.897 Å) → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**.
*   **Conclusion**: 1-pentene is an alkene, and its intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly *smaller* than that of adsorbed propylene (5.051 Å). Given the MOF's demonstrated ability to adsorb propylene and its preference for alkenes, 1-pentene is expected to be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Co-gallate MOF**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   **MOF's known behavior**: The Co-gallate MOF adsorbs alkenes (ethylene 4.047 Å, propylene 5.051 Å) but rejects alkanes (ethane 4.175 Å, propane 4.354 Å). This demonstrates a strong shape-selective/kinetic sieving effect favoring alkenes.
*   **Target molecule dimensions**: trans-2-pentene (8.796×4.733×4.564 Å) → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**.
*   **Conclusion**: trans-2-pentene is an alkene, and its intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls between that of adsorbed ethylene (4.047 Å) and adsorbed propylene (5.051 Å). Given the MOF's demonstrated ability to adsorb these alkenes and its preference for this molecular class, trans-2-pentene is expected to be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Co-gallate MOF**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
*   **MOF's known behavior**: The Co-gallate MOF specifically rejects alkanes (ethane 4.175 Å, propane 4.354 Å) even when their intermediate dimensions are smaller than those of adsorbed alkenes. This indicates a strong kinetic sieving/shape exclusion mechanism against linear alkanes.
*   **Target molecule dimensions**: n-pentane (9.118×4.364×3.969 Å) → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**.
*   **Conclusion**: n-pentane is a linear alkane. Its intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is comparable to or slightly larger than that of rejected propane (4.354 Å) and rejected ethane (4.175 Å). Given the observed kinetic sieving behavior where alkanes are excluded, n-pentane is highly unlikely to be adsorbed by the Co-gallate MOF.
