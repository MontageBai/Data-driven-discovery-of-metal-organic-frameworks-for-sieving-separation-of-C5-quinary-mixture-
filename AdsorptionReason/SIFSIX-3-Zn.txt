MOF Name: SIFSIX-3-Zn
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-3-Zn:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by SIFSIX-3-Zn due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: SIFSIX-3-Zn
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-3-Zn:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by SIFSIX-3-Zn due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: SIFSIX-3-Zn
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-3-Zn:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by SIFSIX-3-Zn due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: SIFSIX-3-Zn
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SIFSIX-3-Zn:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by SIFSIX-3-Zn due to size exclusion.

Inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn:
The MOF can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of SIFSIX-3-Zn (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by SIFSIX-3-Zn due to size exclusion.
