MOF Name: BF4-BTR
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BF4-BTR:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (via Temperature-dependent, Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (via Temperature-dependent, Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups)

The provided experimental data for BF4-BTR explicitly states a "Temperature-dependent" adsorption mechanism involving "Temporary deviation of gate-keeping groups." This indicates that BF4-BTR is a flexible MOF, and its adsorption behavior is governed by a dynamic, gate-opening process rather than a rigid, fixed pore size exclusion.

Based on the largest molecule known to be adsorbed by this gate-opening mechanism, the MOF can accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.877 Å (methane). No molecules are reported as 'Not Adsorbed' due to size exclusion, which means a rigid upper limit for the pore size cannot be determined from the provided data using a strict size exclusion model.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimensions of molecules experimentally shown to be adsorbed (methane: 3.877 Å; carbon dioxide: 3.200 Å) by BF4-BTR's gate-opening mechanism. While the MOF exhibits flexibility, there is an inherent physical limit to how much the gate-keeping groups can deviate. Without experimental evidence of the gate opening for molecules of this size, it is highly unlikely that the "temporary deviation" is sufficient to accommodate molecules that are substantially larger than those already proven to pass. Therefore, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed under these conditions.
