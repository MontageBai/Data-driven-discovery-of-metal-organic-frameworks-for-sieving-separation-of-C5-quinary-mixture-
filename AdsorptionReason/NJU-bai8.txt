MOF Name: NJU-bai8
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NJU-bai8:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes) via Gate-opening effect
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional) via Gate-opening effect

Inferred effective pore size of NJU-bai8:
The MOF exhibits a "Gate-opening effect," meaning its pore size is not fixed but can dynamically adjust. Based on the provided data, the largest molecule that has been experimentally confirmed to adsorb is propylene, with an intermediate dimension of **5.051 Å**. This indicates that the MOF can open to at least this size. Since there is no experimental data for a molecule failing to adsorb due to size exclusion, an upper limit for the MOF's maximum possible opening cannot be established from the given data. For the purpose of prediction, we assume the MOF's *demonstrated* maximum effective pore size is 5.051 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly confirmed to adsorb by NJU-bai8 (propylene, 5.051 Å). Although NJU-bai8 exhibits a gate-opening effect, the provided data does not confirm its ability to open wider than 5.051 Å to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, based strictly on the available experimental data, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly confirmed to adsorb by NJU-bai8 (propylene, 5.051 Å). Although NJU-bai8 exhibits a gate-opening effect, the provided data does not confirm its ability to open wider than 5.051 Å to accommodate molecules of this size. Therefore, based strictly on the available experimental data, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: NJU-bai8
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NJU-bai8:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes) via Gate-opening effect
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional) via Gate-opening effect

Inferred effective pore size of NJU-bai8:
The MOF exhibits a "Gate-opening effect," meaning its pore size is not fixed but can dynamically adjust. Based on the provided data, the largest molecule that has been experimentally confirmed to adsorb is propylene, with an intermediate dimension of **5.051 Å**. This indicates that the MOF can open to at least this size. While propane (4.354 Å, smaller than propylene) is "Conditional," the gate-opening mechanism for propylene demonstrates that the MOF can accommodate molecules up to 5.051 Å under the given conditions.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of propylene (5.051 Å), which is confirmed to adsorb by NJU-bai8 via the gate-opening effect. Given that the MOF can open to accommodate propylene, it is reasonable to conclude that it can also accommodate 1-pentene. Therefore, based on the available experimental data, it is predicted that 1-pentene can be adsorbed.
