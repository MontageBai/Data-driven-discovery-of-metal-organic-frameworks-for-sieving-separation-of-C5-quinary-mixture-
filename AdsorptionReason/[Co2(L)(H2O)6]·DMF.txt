**MOF Name: [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF: Since carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å was *not* adsorbed, the effective pore size of this MOF is inferred to be **less than 3.200 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF (< 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF**

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From the experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF: Since carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å was *not* adsorbed, the effective pore size of this MOF is inferred to be **less than 3.200 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of [Co2(L)(H2O)6]·DMF (< 3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.
