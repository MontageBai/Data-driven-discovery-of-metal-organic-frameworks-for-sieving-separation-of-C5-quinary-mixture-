MOF Name: ZIF-L
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-L:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
No other molecules are explicitly listed as adsorbed or as being excluded due to size for ZIF-L in the provided data.

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-L: The available data indicates that ZIF-L can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, no upper limit for the pore size can be definitively inferred from the single "adsorbed" data point provided.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any additional experimental data for ZIF-L indicating adsorption of larger molecules or an explicit upper exclusion limit, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-L due to potential size exclusion. The provided data is insufficient to definitively confirm adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å.

MOF Name: ZIF-L
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-L:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
No other molecules are explicitly listed as adsorbed or as being excluded due to size for ZIF-L in the provided data.

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-L: The available data indicates that ZIF-L can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, no upper limit for the pore size can be definitively inferred from the single "adsorbed" data point provided.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any additional experimental data for ZIF-L indicating adsorption of larger molecules or an explicit upper exclusion limit, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-L due to potential size exclusion. The provided data is insufficient to definitively confirm adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any additional experimental data for ZIF-L indicating adsorption of larger molecules or an explicit upper exclusion limit, it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-L due to potential size exclusion. The provided data is insufficient to definitively confirm adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å.

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any additional experimental data for ZIF-L indicating adsorption of larger molecules or an explicit upper exclusion limit, it is predicted that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-L due to potential size exclusion. The provided data is insufficient to definitively confirm adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å.
