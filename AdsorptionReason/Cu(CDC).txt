MOF Name: Cu(CDC)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(CDC) is at least **6.501 Å**, as ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å) was successfully adsorbed. There is no information about non-adsorbed molecules to establish an upper bound for the pore size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Cu(CDC).

MOF Name: Cu(CDC)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(CDC) is at least **6.501 Å**, as ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å) was successfully adsorbed. There is no information about non-adsorbed molecules to establish an upper bound for the pore size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Cu(CDC).

MOF Name: Cu(CDC)
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(CDC) is at least **6.501 Å**, as ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å) was successfully adsorbed. There is no information about non-adsorbed molecules to establish an upper bound for the pore size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Cu(CDC).

MOF Name: Cu(CDC)
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(CDC) is at least **6.501 Å**, as ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å) was successfully adsorbed. There is no information about non-adsorbed molecules to establish an upper bound for the pore size.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Cu(CDC).

MOF Name: Cu(CDC)
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = 6.501 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(CDC) is at least **6.501 Å**, as ethylbenzene (intermediate dimension 6.501 Å) was successfully adsorbed. There is no information about non-adsorbed molecules to establish an upper bound for the pore size.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.501 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Cu(CDC).
