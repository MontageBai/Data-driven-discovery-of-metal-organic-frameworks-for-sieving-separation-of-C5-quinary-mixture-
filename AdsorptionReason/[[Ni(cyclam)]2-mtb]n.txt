Here's the detailed analysis and prediction for each guest molecule for the MOF [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n, based on the provided data:

**MOF Name: [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited for oxygen adsorption is "Molecular sieving achieved via restricted window sizes," which implies that the pore size of [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n is closely tailored to allow oxygen but exclude larger molecules. This suggests an effective pore size only slightly greater than 2.860 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of adsorbed oxygen (2.860 Å), and the MOF explicitly demonstrates molecular sieving via restricted window sizes for oxygen, it is highly likely that isoprene would be size-excluded.

**MOF Name: [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited for oxygen adsorption is "Molecular sieving achieved via restricted window sizes," which implies that the pore size of [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n is closely tailored to allow oxygen but exclude larger molecules. This suggests an effective pore size only slightly greater than 2.860 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of adsorbed oxygen (2.860 Å), and the MOF explicitly demonstrates molecular sieving via restricted window sizes for oxygen, it is highly likely that cis-2-pentene would be size-excluded.

**MOF Name: [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited for oxygen adsorption is "Molecular sieving achieved via restricted window sizes," which implies that the pore size of [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n is closely tailored to allow oxygen but exclude larger molecules. This suggests an effective pore size only slightly greater than 2.860 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of adsorbed oxygen (2.860 Å), and the MOF explicitly demonstrates molecular sieving via restricted window sizes for oxygen, it is highly likely that 1-pentene would be size-excluded.

**MOF Name: [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited for oxygen adsorption is "Molecular sieving achieved via restricted window sizes," which implies that the pore size of [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n is closely tailored to allow oxygen but exclude larger molecules. This suggests an effective pore size only slightly greater than 2.860 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of adsorbed oxygen (2.860 Å), and the MOF explicitly demonstrates molecular sieving via restricted window sizes for oxygen, it is highly likely that trans-2-pentene would be size-excluded.

**MOF Name: [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed. The reason cited for oxygen adsorption is "Molecular sieving achieved via restricted window sizes," which implies that the pore size of [[Ni(cyclam)]2-mtb]n is closely tailored to allow oxygen but exclude larger molecules. This suggests an effective pore size only slightly greater than 2.860 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of adsorbed oxygen (2.860 Å), and the MOF explicitly demonstrates molecular sieving via restricted window sizes for oxygen, it is highly likely that n-pentane would be size-excluded.
