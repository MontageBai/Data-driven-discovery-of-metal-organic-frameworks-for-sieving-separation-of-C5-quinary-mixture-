MOF Name: MoOFOUR-Co-tpb
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MoOFOUR-Co-tpb:
-   **3-methylpentane**: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
-   **2,2-dimethylbutane**: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of MoOFOUR-Co-tpb:
The MOF adsorbed 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å) and did not adsorb 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate 6.545 Å) due to size exclusion. This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å. Thus, the inferred effective pore size range is [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   **isoprene**: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range ([6.008 Å, 6.545 Å)), it is geometrically compatible and should be adsorbed by MoOFOUR-Co-tpb.

MOF Name: MoOFOUR-Co-tpb
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MoOFOUR-Co-tpb:
-   **3-methylpentane**: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
-   **2,2-dimethylbutane**: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of MoOFOUR-Co-tpb:
The MOF adsorbed 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å) and did not adsorb 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate 6.545 Å) due to size exclusion. This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å. Thus, the inferred effective pore size range is [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
-   **cis-2-pentene**: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which was successfully adsorbed, it is expected to be adsorbed by MoOFOUR-Co-tpb.

This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å. Thus, the inferred effective pore size range is [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å).

1-pentene Dimensions:
-   **1-pentene**: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which was successfully adsorbed, it is expected to be adsorbed by MoOFOUR-Co-tpb.
