Based on the provided experimental data and molecular size information, here's the detailed analysis for `[Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]`:

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for `[Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]`:
*   **Propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **Propylene:** 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to "Exclusion based on pore geometry")

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of `[Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]` is:
*   Greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å).
*   Less than the intermediate dimension of propylene (5.051 Å).

Therefore, the effective pore size range for `[Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]` is **[4.354 Å, 5.051 Å)**.

**2. Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

*   **Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] lies between 4.354 Å (adsorbed propane) and 5.051 Å (non-adsorbed propylene).
    *   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → **Intermediate = 6.093 Å**
    *   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

*   **Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] lies between 4.354 Å (adsorbed propane) and 5.051 Å (non-adsorbed propylene).
    *   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → **Intermediate = 5.572 Å**
    *   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is greater than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

*   **Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] lies between 4.354 Å (adsorbed propane) and 5.051 Å (non-adsorbed propylene).
    *   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → **Intermediate = 4.995 Å**
    *   Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range (4.354 Å ≤ dimension < 5.051 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]. While its size is very close to the exclusion threshold observed for propylene (5.051 Å), based purely on size exclusion criteria, it should be able to pass.

**MOF Name: [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

*   **Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] lies between 4.354 Å (adsorbed propane) and 5.051 Å (non-adsorbed propylene).
    *   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → **Intermediate = 4.733 Å**
    *   Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range (4.354 Å ≤ dimension < 5.051 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)].

**MOF Name: [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)]**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

*   **Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)] lies between 4.354 Å (adsorbed propane) and 5.051 Å (non-adsorbed propylene).
    *   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → **Intermediate = 4.364 Å**
    *   Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range (4.354 Å ≤ dimension < 5.051 Å) and is very close to the adsorbed propane's intermediate dimension (4.354 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by [Ni(bpe)2(WO4)].
