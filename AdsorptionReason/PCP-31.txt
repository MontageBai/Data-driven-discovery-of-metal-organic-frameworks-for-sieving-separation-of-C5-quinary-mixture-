MOF Name: PCP-31
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for PCP-31:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed

Analysis of PCP-31's inferred effective pore size:
The experimental data shows that PCP-31 adsorbs acetylene (intermediate dimension: 3.200 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size of PCP-31 is at least 3.200 Å.
However, carbon dioxide, which also has an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, is reported as not adsorbed by PCP-31. This cannot be explained by a simple size exclusion effect where the pore is *smaller* than 3.200 Å for CO2, as this would contradict the adsorption of acetylene. Instead, this highly selective behavior between two molecules with the same nominal intermediate dimension strongly suggests a **kinetic sieving** or precise **shape selectivity** mechanism. It implies that the pore is very tightly tuned around 3.200 Å, allowing acetylene to pass but posing a significant barrier for CO2 due to subtle differences in molecular shape, flexibility, or specific interactions within the pore, even if their reported intermediate dimensions are identical.

Given this tight selectivity at 3.200 Å, it can be inferred that PCP-31's effective pore size is only marginally larger than 3.200 Å, and it is highly restrictive to molecules that are even slightly larger.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size (which is tightly tuned around 3.200 Å), it is predicted to be excluded by PCP-31 due to size exclusion.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
