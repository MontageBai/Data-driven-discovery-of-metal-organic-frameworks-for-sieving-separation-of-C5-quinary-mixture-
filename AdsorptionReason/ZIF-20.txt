MOF Name: ZIF-20
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-20:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Dynamic window-widening process)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-20:
Based on the experimental data, ZIF-20 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide, potentially through dynamic window-widening, indicating a tight fit or flexible pore) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. This strongly suggests that the effective pore aperture of ZIF-20 is less than 3.877 Å, likely around 3.200 Å or slightly larger due to flexibility. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size is between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å, effectively filtering out molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or larger.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of ZIF-20's inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-20.
