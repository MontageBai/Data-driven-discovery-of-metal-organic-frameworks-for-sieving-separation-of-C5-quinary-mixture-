MOF Name: Hf-MOF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-MOF:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Conditional (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Hf-MOF is able to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å and larger. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Hf-MOF
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-MOF:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Conditional (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Hf-MOF is able to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å and larger. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Hf-MOF
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-MOF:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Conditional (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Hf-MOF is able to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å and larger. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Hf-MOF
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-MOF:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Conditional (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Hf-MOF is able to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å and larger. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-MOF due to size exclusion.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-MOF:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Hf-MOF is able to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å and larger. Therefore, the effective pore size is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-MOF due to size exclusion.
