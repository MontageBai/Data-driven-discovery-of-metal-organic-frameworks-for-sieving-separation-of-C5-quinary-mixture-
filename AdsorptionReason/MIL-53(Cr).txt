MOF Name: MIL-53(Cr)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-53(Cr):
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-53(Cr) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions less than ~3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MIL-53(Cr).

MOF Name: MIL-53(Cr)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-53(Cr):
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-53(Cr) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions less than ~3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MIL-53(Cr).

MOF Name: MIL-53(Cr)
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-53(Cr):
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-53(Cr) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions less than ~3.877 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MIL-53(Cr).

Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-53(Cr):
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-53(Cr) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions less than ~3.877 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MIL-53(Cr).

MOF Name: MIL-53(Cr)
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-53(Cr):
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-53(Cr) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimensions less than ~3.877 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MIL-53(Cr).
