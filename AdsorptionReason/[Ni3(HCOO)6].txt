MOF Name: [Ni3(HCOO)6]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Ni3(HCOO)6]:
-   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
-   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

The MOF [Ni3(HCOO)6] demonstrates a highly precise sieving behavior at the sub-nanometer scale. While both acetylene and carbon dioxide have an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, acetylene is adsorbed, and carbon dioxide is not due to size exclusion. This indicates that the effective pore size is extremely close to 3.200 Å, allowing acetylene but excluding carbon dioxide. This fine distinction points to either subtle shape differences impacting the effective kinetic diameter or specific interactions leading to a kinetic sieving effect, even when the intermediate dimensions are numerically identical.

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the effective pore size of approximately 3.200 Å (which already excludes carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å), isoprene cannot be adsorbed by [Ni3(HCOO)6].
