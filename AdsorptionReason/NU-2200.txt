MOF Name: NU-2200
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NU-2200:
-   hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 Å → Intermediate = 6.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
-   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size and sieving behavior of NU-2200:
The data indicates that NU-2200 exhibits complex kinetic sieving. While it can adsorb singly-branched molecules like 2-methylpentane (intermediate dimension 6.376 Å) through kinetic sieving, it strictly excludes more compact, doubly-branched molecules such as 2,3-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.170 Å) and 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the pore's ability to pass molecules is highly dependent on their overall shape and bulkiness, not solely on the intermediate dimension. The effective pore opening for bulky molecules appears to be more restrictive than for flexible/linear ones. Specifically, the smallest intermediate dimension of a *non-adsorbed* molecule due to size exclusion is 6.170 Å (for 2,3-dimethylbutane), indicating that molecules with similar bulkiness and intermediate dimensions around or above this value are excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is very close to that of 2,3-dimethylbutane (6.170 Å), which was excluded by size exclusion. Both molecules are branched and relatively compact. Despite 2-methylpentane (6.376 Å) being adsorbed, this was noted as kinetic sieving, implying a specific, tight fit. Given the strict size exclusion of 2,3-dimethylbutane, it is highly probable that isoprene, with its similar intermediate dimension and branched, somewhat bulky structure, would also be excluded by the same mechanism.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: NU-2200
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NU-2200:
-   hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
-   2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 Å → Intermediate = 6.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
-   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size and sieving behavior of NU-2200:
The MOF can accommodate linear and singly-branched molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 6.376 Å. However, it strictly excludes more compact, doubly-branched molecules from an intermediate dimension of 6.170 Å upwards due to size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
-   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene is a linear-ish molecule (pentene, a 5-carbon chain) and its intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly smaller than the smallest excluded branched molecule (2,3-dimethylbutane, 6.170 Å). It is also smaller than the adsorbed branched molecules (3-methylpentane 6.008 Å, 2-methylpentane 6.376 Å). Given its linear nature and smaller intermediate dimension compared to the identified exclusion threshold for bulky molecules, it is highly likely to be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**

1-pentene Dimensions:
-   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene is a linear alkene. Its intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the smallest excluded branched molecule (2,3-dimethylbutane, 6.170 Å) and also comparable to or smaller than several adsorbed molecules, such as hexane (4.607 Å). Given its linear nature and significantly smaller intermediate dimension compared to the identified exclusion threshold for bulky molecules, it is highly likely to be adsorbed.
