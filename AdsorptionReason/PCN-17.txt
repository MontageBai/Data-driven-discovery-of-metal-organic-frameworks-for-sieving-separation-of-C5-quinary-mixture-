MOF Name: PCN-17
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 Å → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed | Adsorption Type: Size-selective adsorption

Inferred effective pore size of PCN-17: The experimental data indicates that PCN-17 exhibits "Size-selective adsorption" for oxygen (intermediate dimension 2.860 Å). This mechanism, coupled with the "Restricted pore apertures differentiate gas adsorption based on molecular size," strongly implies that the effective pore size of PCN-17 is close to, or slightly larger than, 2.860 Å, and that it is designed to exclude molecules larger than this specific range. There is no experimental data provided for a molecule that PCN-17 *cannot* adsorb due to size exclusion, but the nature of the "size-selective adsorption" for a small molecule suggests a tight pore environment.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of oxygen (2.860 Å), which is adsorbed via a size-selective mechanism, it is highly probable that PCN-17's restricted and size-selective pores cannot accommodate isoprene.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of oxygen (2.860 Å), which is adsorbed via a size-selective mechanism, it is highly probable that PCN-17's restricted and size-selective pores cannot accommodate cis-2-pentene.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of oxygen (2.860 Å), which is adsorbed via a size-selective mechanism, it is highly probable that PCN-17's restricted and size-selective pores cannot accommodate 1-pentene.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of oxygen (2.860 Å), which is adsorbed via a size-selective mechanism, it is highly probable that PCN-17's restricted and size-selective pores cannot accommodate trans-2-pentene.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of oxygen (2.860 Å), which is adsorbed via a size-selective mechanism, it is highly probable that PCN-17's restricted and size-selective pores cannot accommodate n-pentane.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
