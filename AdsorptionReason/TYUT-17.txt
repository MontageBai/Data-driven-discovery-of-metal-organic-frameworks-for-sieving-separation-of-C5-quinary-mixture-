MOF Name: TYUT-17
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for TYUT-17:
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional)
Both ethane and ethylene are adsorbed by TYUT-17 via a "Gate-opening" mechanism at or below 1 bar.

Inferred effective pore size of TYUT-17:
Based on the provided experimental data, TYUT-17 demonstrates the ability to adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 4.175 Å (ethane's intermediate dimension) by undergoing a gate-opening phenomenon. This indicates a flexible pore structure capable of adapting to guest molecules. However, the provided data *does not include any molecules that were explicitly rejected due to size exclusion*. This absence prevents the inference of a precise upper limit for the MOF's effective pore size based on size exclusion data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by TYUT-17 (ethane, 4.175 Å). While the "Gate-opening" mechanism suggests flexibility, its range is not quantified by the provided data. Given the strict focus on geometric compatibility and the lack of experimental confirmation for adsorption of molecules larger than 4.175 Å under standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar), it is concluded that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by TYUT-17. Assuming adsorption for significantly larger molecules without supporting data would be an unsubstantiated extrapolation beyond the demonstrated capacity.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
