MOF Name: Fe2(O2)(dobdc)

**Detailed Reasoning:**

From the provided experimental data for Fe2(O2)(dobdc):
*   **Ethane**: Dimensions 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = **4.175 Å**. Adsorbed (Yes).
*   **Ethylene**: Dimensions 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = **4.047 Å**. Not Adsorbed (No), with "Size exclusion" and "Kinetic sieving" reported as mechanisms.

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Fe2(O2)(dobdc):**
According to the rules:
1.  The MOF adsorbs ethane (intermediate dimension 4.175 Å). This suggests the effective pore size is at least 4.175 Å.
2.  The MOF *does not* adsorb ethylene (intermediate dimension 4.047 Å) due to "size exclusion". This would typically suggest the effective pore size is less than 4.047 Å.

This presents a contradiction: The MOF is stated to adsorb a molecule (ethane, 4.175 Å) that has a larger intermediate dimension than a molecule it excludes by "size exclusion" (ethylene, 4.047 Å). This indicates that the "size exclusion" for ethylene is not based on a simple geometric cutoff where its intermediate dimension is too large for the pore. Instead, as indicated by the "Kinetic sieving" mechanism, this material exhibits highly selective separation where subtle differences in molecular shape, flexibility, or specific interactions with the pore walls (even for smaller molecules) lead to effective "size exclusion".

For the purpose of predicting the adsorption of *other* molecules based on intermediate dimensions, we must rely on the largest molecule known to be adsorbed. Since ethane (4.175 Å) is adsorbed, the MOF's pores are demonstrably capable of accommodating molecules up to at least this intermediate dimension. Therefore, molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 4.175 Å are highly unlikely to be adsorbed by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).

**Evaluations for Target Guest Molecules:**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å
*   Intermediate Dimension: **6.093 Å**
*   Comparison: 6.093 Å (isoprene) > 4.175 Å (ethane, largest adsorbed molecule)
*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethane (4.175 Å), which is the largest molecule observed to be adsorbed, isoprene is predicted to be excluded by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å
*   Intermediate Dimension: **5.572 Å**
*   Comparison: 5.572 Å (cis-2-pentene) > 4.175 Å (ethane, largest adsorbed molecule)
*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**
*   Conclusion: cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than that of ethane (4.175 Å). Therefore, it is predicted to be excluded by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.995 Å**
*   Comparison: 4.995 Å (1-pentene) > 4.175 Å (ethane, largest adsorbed molecule)
*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**
*   Conclusion: 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than that of ethane (4.175 Å). Hence, it is predicted to be excluded by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.733 Å**
*   Comparison: 4.733 Å (trans-2-pentene) > 4.175 Å (ethane, largest adsorbed molecule)
*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**
*   Conclusion: trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is larger than that of ethane (4.175 Å). Therefore, it is predicted to be excluded by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).

**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**
*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.364 Å**
*   Comparison: 4.364 Å (n-pentane) > 4.175 Å (ethane, largest adsorbed molecule)
*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**
*   Conclusion: n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than that of ethane (4.175 Å). Hence, it is predicted to be excluded by Fe2(O2)(dobdc).
