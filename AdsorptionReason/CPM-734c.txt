Here's the analysis for CPM-734c and the target guest molecules based on the provided data:

**Known Guest Molecule Probe Sizes (Intermediate Dimension highlighted):**

*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×**5.572**×5.136 Å
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×**4.733**×4.564 Å
*   1-pentene: 8.847×**4.995**×4.897 Å
*   n-pentane: 9.118×**4.364**×3.969 Å
*   isoprene: 7.746×**6.093**×3.963 Å
*   propane: 6.552×**4.354**×3.970 Å
*   propylene: 6.257×**5.051**×3.961 Å

**Experimental Adsorption Data for CPM-734c:**

*   CPM-734c, propane, Yes, Preferential adsorption of C3H8 via pore optimization, Preferential adsorption, 298 K, 0.1 bar, Not Applicable
*   CPM-734c, propylene, No, Preferential adsorption of C3H8 via pore optimization, Exclusion based on pore optimization, 298 K, 0.1 bar, Not Applicable

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of CPM-734c:**

*   From experimental data:
    *   Propane: Intermediate = **4.354 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   Propylene: Intermediate = **5.051 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Exclusion based on pore optimization)

*   Based on these observations, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is greater than or equal to 4.354 Å (since propane is adsorbed) and less than 5.051 Å (since propylene is excluded).
*   Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range for CPM-734c is **[4.354 Å, 5.051 Å)**.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: CPM-734c**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is between **4.354 Å** (adsorbs propane) and **5.051 Å** (excludes propylene).
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by CPM-734c based on size exclusion.

**MOF Name: CPM-734c**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is between **4.354 Å** (adsorbs propane) and **5.051 Å** (excludes propylene).
cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by CPM-734c based on size exclusion.

**MOF Name: CPM-734c**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is between **4.354 Å** (adsorbs propane) and **5.051 Å** (excludes propylene).
1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å), specifically being larger than adsorbed propane but smaller than excluded propylene, it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by CPM-734c. The mechanism for propylene exclusion was "pore optimization," which suggests a kinetic sieving effect where precise molecular fit is crucial. However, based strictly on the intermediate dimension for size exclusion, 1-pentene should pass.

**MOF Name: CPM-734c**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is between **4.354 Å** (adsorbs propane) and **5.051 Å** (excludes propylene).
trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å), specifically being larger than adsorbed propane but smaller than excluded propylene, it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by CPM-734c.

**MOF Name: CPM-734c**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the inferred effective pore size of CPM-734c is between **4.354 Å** (adsorbs propane) and **5.051 Å** (excludes propylene).
n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**
Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å), specifically being very close to and slightly larger than adsorbed propane but well below excluded propylene, it is predicted that it can be adsorbed by CPM-734c.
