MOF Name: HIAM-203
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for HIAM-203:
- Hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of HIAM-203:
The material can adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 6.008 Å (conditionally, implying a tight fit or kinetic limitations). It strictly excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Therefore, the effective pore size is sensitive to dimensions in the range of [~6.008 Å, 6.545 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since 3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å) is already adsorbed only conditionally, and isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than 3-methylpentane's, isoprene is likely too large to pass through the pore, similar to how 2,2-dimethylbutane is excluded. The "Conditional" adsorption for 3-methylpentane suggests that 6.008 Å is at or very near the effective pore opening, making a slightly larger molecule like isoprene unable to pass.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: HIAM-203
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for HIAM-203:
- Hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of HIAM-203:
The material can adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 6.008 Å (conditionally). It strictly excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Thus, molecules smaller than or equal to ~6.008 Å can be adsorbed.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which can be conditionally adsorbed, and also larger than hexane (4.607 Å) which is fully adsorbed, it falls well within the range of adsorbable molecules.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**

Inferred effective pore size of HIAM-203:
The material can adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 6.008 Å (conditionally). It strictly excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å. Thus, molecules smaller than or equal to ~6.008 Å can be adsorbed.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which can be conditionally adsorbed, and also larger than hexane (4.607 Å) which is fully adsorbed, it falls well within the range of adsorbable molecules.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than hexane (4.607 Å), which is known to be fully adsorbed, it should readily be adsorbed by HIAM-203.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
