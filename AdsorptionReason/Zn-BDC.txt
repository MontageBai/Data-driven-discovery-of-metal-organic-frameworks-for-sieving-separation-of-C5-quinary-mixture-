MOF Name: Zn-BDC
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BDC:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Cyclohexene: 6.976×6.561×5.022 → Intermediate = 6.561 Å | Adsorbed (Conditional, indicating a tight fit or kinetic sieving)
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to Size exclusion, even at 60 °C)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-BDC:
The MOF is known to adsorb benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) and cyclohexene (intermediate dimension 6.561 Å). However, it explicitly *cannot* adsorb cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å) due to size exclusion. This indicates that the effective pore size of Zn-BDC is large enough to accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 6.762 Å, but is smaller than 6.949 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size lies between approximately 6.762 Å and 6.949 Å. The experimental data also mentions "Temperature-dependent molecular sieving," suggesting the pore size can slightly adjust, but the size exclusion for cyclohexane provides a clear upper limit for passage.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by Zn-BDC, and also well below the upper limit inferred from cyclohexane's non-adsorption (6.949 Å), isoprene is predicted to be adsorbed by Zn-BDC.
