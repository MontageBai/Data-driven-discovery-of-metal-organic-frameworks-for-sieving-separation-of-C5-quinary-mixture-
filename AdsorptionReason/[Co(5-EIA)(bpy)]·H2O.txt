MOF Name: [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed

The experimental data explicitly states that the MOF has a "pore size (4.38 Å)". This directly indicates the effective pore aperture. All adsorbed molecules (carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane) have intermediate dimensions (3.200 Å, 3.200 Å, and 3.877 Å respectively) that are smaller than or equal to this stated pore size, which is consistent.

Therefore, the effective pore size of [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O is considered to be 4.38 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the MOF's effective pore size (4.38 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Co(5-EIA)(bpy)]·H2O:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is slightly smaller than the MOF's effective pore size (4.38 Å), it is geometrically possible for it to pass through the pore and be adsorbed. This suggests a very tight fit, which could lead to slow diffusion or kinetic sieving effects, but based purely on size exclusion, it 'can adsorb'.
