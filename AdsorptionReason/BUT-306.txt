MOF Name: BUT-306
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-306:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-306 lies between **3.961 Å and 5.051 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but less than 5.051 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BUT-306 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: BUT-306
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-306:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-306 lies between **3.961 Å and 5.051 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but less than 5.051 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (5.051 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by BUT-306 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: BUT-306
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-306:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-306 lies between **3.961 Å and 5.051 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but less than 5.051 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is greater than the lower bound (3.961 Å) and less than the upper bound (5.051 Å) of the inferred effective pore size, it can be adsorbed by BUT-306. Given the tight fit, kinetic sieving might play a role in its diffusion rate compared to smaller molecules.

MOF Name: BUT-306
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-306:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-306 lies between **3.961 Å and 5.051 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but less than 5.051 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is greater than the lower bound (3.961 Å) and less than the upper bound (5.051 Å) of the inferred effective pore size, it can be adsorbed by BUT-306. Given the tight fit, kinetic sieving might play a role in its diffusion rate compared to smaller molecules.

MOF Name: BUT-306
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-306:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-306 lies between **3.961 Å and 5.051 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.961 Å but less than 5.051 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is greater than the lower bound (3.961 Å) and less than the upper bound (5.051 Å) of the inferred effective pore size, it can be adsorbed by BUT-306. Given the tight fit, kinetic sieving might play a role in its diffusion rate compared to smaller molecules.
