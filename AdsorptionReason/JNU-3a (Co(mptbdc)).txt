To determine whether JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc)) can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we will analyze the provided experimental data and molecular dimensions.

**1. Inferring JNU-3a’s Effective Pore Characteristics:**
From the experimental data for JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc)):
*   **Propylene:** 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = **5.051 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes) | Mechanism: Gate-opening separation
*   **Propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = **4.354 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes) | Mechanism: Gate-opening separation

Based on this, the MOF JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc)) can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 5.051 Å (propylene). The stated mechanism, "Gate-opening separation," indicates that the MOF possesses a flexible or dynamic framework that can adjust its pore dimensions to facilitate adsorption. Crucially, there is no experimental data indicating non-adsorption due to size exclusion for any molecule with this MOF, meaning an upper bound for a rigid pore size cannot be inferred from the provided data.

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

*   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
*   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
*   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
*   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

**MOF Name: JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc))**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for JNU-3a:
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF JNU-3a has shown adsorption for molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene). The observed adsorption mechanism is "Gate-opening separation," which implies a dynamic and flexible pore structure capable of adapting to guest molecules.
Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
While isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than that of the largest experimentally adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å), the "Gate-opening separation" mechanism indicates the MOF's flexibility. Without any experimental data showing non-adsorption (size exclusion) for this MOF to establish an upper pore size limit, and given the dynamic nature of the pore, it is plausible that JNU-3a can accommodate isoprene. Therefore, based on the demonstrated flexibility, it is predicted to adsorb.

**MOF Name: JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc))**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for JNU-3a:
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF JNU-3a has shown adsorption for molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene). The observed adsorption mechanism is "Gate-opening separation," which implies a dynamic and flexible pore structure capable of adapting to guest molecules.
cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Similar to isoprene, cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is slightly larger than that of the largest experimentally adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å). However, the "Gate-opening separation" mechanism suggests that JNU-3a is flexible. In the absence of experimental data establishing an upper limit for non-adsorption, and considering the MOF's dynamic nature, it is reasonable to predict that JNU-3a can adsorb cis-2-pentene.

**MOF Name: JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc))**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for JNU-3a:
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF JNU-3a has shown adsorption for molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene).
1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) by JNU-3a, it falls well within the experimentally proven adsorption capability of the MOF. Therefore, JNU-3a can adsorb 1-pentene.

**MOF Name: JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc))**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for JNU-3a:
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF JNU-3a has shown adsorption for molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene).
trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) by JNU-3a, it falls within the experimentally proven adsorption capability of the MOF. Therefore, JNU-3a can adsorb trans-2-pentene.

**MOF Name: JNU-3a (Co(mptbdc))**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for JNU-3a:
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF JNU-3a has shown adsorption for molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene).
n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is very close to and slightly larger than propane (4.354 Å) and smaller than propylene (5.051 Å), both of which are adsorbed by JNU-3a, it falls well within the experimentally proven adsorption capability of the MOF. Therefore, JNU-3a can adsorb n-pentane.
