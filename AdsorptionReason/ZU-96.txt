MOF Name: ZU-96

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of ZU-96:**
From the experimental data, ZU-96 adsorbs butadiene (7.663×5.161×3.200 Å) with an intermediate dimension of **5.161 Å**. The experimental notes mention "Size exclusion and gate-opening effect based on flexible pore size tuning, Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". This suggests that while the MOF's pores can flexibly tune or gate-open to accommodate butadiene, it's doing so at a "sub-nanometer scale" with "size exclusion" mentioned as a factor, implying that butadiene is at or near the upper limit of what the pore can accommodate, even with flexibility. Therefore, we infer the effective pore size of ZU-96 to be approximately **5.161 Å**. Molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than this are likely to be excluded.

MOF Name: ZU-96
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Butadiene: 7.663×5.161×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 5.161 Å | Adsorbed (ZU-96)
Inferred effective pore size of ZU-96 is approximately **5.161 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the inferred effective pore size of ZU-96 (approx. 5.161 Å), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Butadiene: 7.663×5.161×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 5.161 Å | Adsorbed (ZU-96)
