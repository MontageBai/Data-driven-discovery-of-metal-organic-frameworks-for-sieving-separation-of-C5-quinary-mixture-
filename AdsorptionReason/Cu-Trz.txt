MOF Name: Cu-Trz

**Understanding Cu-Trz's Effective Pore Size:**

From the provided experimental data for Cu-Trz:
*   **Carbon dioxide (CO2)**: Dimensions: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → **Intermediate Dimension = 3.200 Å**. Adsorbed (Type: Kinetic sieving).
*   **Acetylene (C2H2)**: Dimensions: 5.538×3.200×3.200 Å → **Intermediate Dimension = 3.200 Å**. Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion, "Three-dimensional restricted molecular-sieving based on length difference.").

**Inference for Cu-Trz's Pore Size:**

The experimental data for Cu-Trz presents a nuanced situation when strictly applying the rule that "the main concern is the intermediate size of the molecule" for size exclusion.
*   Carbon Dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) is adsorbed, indicating that the MOF's pores are at least large enough to accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å.
*   However, Acetylene, which also has an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, is *not* adsorbed due to "Size exclusion" related to "length difference". This suggests that for Cu-Trz, while the intermediate dimension is a primary concern, other molecular dimensions (such as the largest dimension: 5.538 Å for acetylene vs. 5.198 Å for CO2) or specific molecular shapes also play a critical role in determining complete exclusion, especially when intermediate dimensions are identical and the fit is tight.

Strictly following the prompt's instruction to prioritize the intermediate dimension for "passing through", and given that CO2 (intermediate 3.200 Å) *is* adsorbed, we infer that the effective pore size of Cu-Trz allows molecules with intermediate dimensions *up to at least 3.200 Å*. Any molecule with an intermediate dimension significantly greater than 3.200 Å is therefore predicted to be excluded due to size constraints based on its intermediate dimension.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

*   **Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å.
    *   **Intermediate Dimension = 6.093 Å.**
    *   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the maximum intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule by Cu-Trz), it is predicted to be excluded by the Cu-Trz MOF based on size exclusion.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

*   **Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å.
    *   **Intermediate Dimension = 5.572 Å.**
    *   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the maximum intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule by Cu-Trz), it is predicted to be excluded by the Cu-Trz MOF based on size exclusion.

*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å.
    *   **Intermediate Dimension = 4.995 Å.**
    *   Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the maximum intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule by Cu-Trz), it is predicted to be excluded by the Cu-Trz MOF based on size exclusion.

*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å.
    *   **Intermediate Dimension = 4.733 Å.**
    *   Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the maximum intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule by Cu-Trz), it is predicted to be excluded by the Cu-Trz MOF based on size exclusion.

*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å.
    *   **Intermediate Dimension = 4.364 Å.**
    *   Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the maximum intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule by Cu-Trz), it is predicted to be excluded by the Cu-Trz MOF based on size exclusion.
