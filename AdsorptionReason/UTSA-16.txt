MOF Name: UTSA-16
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-16:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Optimal pore cages and strong binding sites for CO2, or Size exclusion)
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion and weaker interactions)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16:
Based on the experimental data, UTSA-16 can adsorb CO2 (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) but cannot adsorb methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size of UTSA-16 is inferred to be between 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å. More specifically, it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å and excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension ≥ 3.877 Å. Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16 (~3.877 Å), isoprene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-16 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: UTSA-16
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-16:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16 is approximately [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16 (~3.877 Å), cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-16 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: UTSA-16
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-16:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16 is approximately [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-16 (~3.877 Å), 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-16 due to size exclusion.
