MOF Name: M-PTC MOFs
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for M-PTC MOFs:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Can Pass Sieving: Yes)

The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) by M-PTC MOFs is explicitly attributed to "Size exclusion based on hydrodynamic radii and uniform pore size distribution." This indicates that the MOF exhibits a precise size-based sieving mechanism, and its pores are effectively sized to allow molecules of approximately 3.200 Å to pass. While the provided data does not include a "non-adsorbed" molecule due to size exclusion, the stated mechanism for CO2 adsorption implies that the pore size is tightly controlled and not significantly larger than the dimensions of CO2. Therefore, it is inferred that the effective pore size of M-PTC MOFs is approximately 3.200 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of M-PTC MOFs (~3.200 Å), it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.
