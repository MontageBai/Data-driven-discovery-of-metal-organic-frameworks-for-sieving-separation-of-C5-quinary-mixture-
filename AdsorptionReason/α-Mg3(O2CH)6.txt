MOF Name: α-Mg3(O2CH)6
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for α-Mg3(O2CH)6:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of α-Mg3(O2CH)6: The MOF adsorbs benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) but excludes cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.762 Å and less than 6.949 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by α-Mg3(O2CH)6, isoprene is predicted to be able to pass through the pores and be adsorbed.

MOF Name: α-Mg3(O2CH)6
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for α-Mg3(O2CH)6:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of α-Mg3(O2CH)6: The MOF adsorbs benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) but excludes cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.762 Å and less than 6.949 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by α-Mg3(O2CH)6, cis-2-pentene is predicted to be able to pass through the pores and be adsorbed.

MOF Name: α-Mg3(O2CH)6
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for α-Mg3(O2CH)6:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of α-Mg3(O2CH)6: The MOF adsorbs benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) but excludes cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.762 Å and less than 6.949 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by α-Mg3(O2CH)6, 1-pentene is predicted to be able to pass through the pores and be adsorbed.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for α-Mg3(O2CH)6:
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Adsorbed
- Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 → Intermediate = 6.949 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of α-Mg3(O2CH)6: The MOF adsorbs benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) but excludes cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å). This indicates that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 6.762 Å and less than 6.949 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by α-Mg3(O2CH)6, trans-2-pentene is predicted to be able to pass through the pores and be adsorbed.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by α-Mg3(O2CH)6, n-pentane is predicted to be able to pass through the pores and be adsorbed.
