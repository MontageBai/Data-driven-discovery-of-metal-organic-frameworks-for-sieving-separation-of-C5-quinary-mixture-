MOF Name: hjm + N387 + E44
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of hjm + N387 + E44: The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) with the stated mechanism "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" implies that the MOF's pores are precisely sized to allow small molecules around this dimension, and are likely restrictive for molecules significantly larger. While a precise upper limit for exclusion isn't given by a "No" data point, the mechanism suggests tight molecular discrimination at the sub-nanometer level.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF exhibits a "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, it is highly probable that isoprene would be excluded due to the limited pore size of hjm + N387 + E44.

MOF Name: hjm + N387 + E44
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF exhibits a "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, it is highly probable that cis-2-pentene would be excluded due to the limited pore size of hjm + N387 + E44.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than carbon dioxide's intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), and the MOF exhibits a "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism, it is highly probable that 1-pentene would be excluded due to the limited pore size of hjm + N387 + E44.
