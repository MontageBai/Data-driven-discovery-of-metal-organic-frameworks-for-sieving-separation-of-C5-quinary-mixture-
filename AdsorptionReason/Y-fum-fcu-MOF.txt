Here is the evaluation for each guest molecule based on the provided data:

**MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Y-fum-fcu-MOF is **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane is excluded by size. There is no information on molecules that *can* adsorb, so we can only establish an upper limit for the pore size based on size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded by size, isoprene is geometrically smaller and can potentially pass through the pores. Based purely on size exclusion, it *can* be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF**

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Y-fum-fcu-MOF is **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane is excluded by size. There is no information on molecules that *can* adsorb, so we can only establish an upper limit for the pore size based on size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded by size, cis-2-pentene is geometrically smaller and can potentially pass through the pores. Based purely on size exclusion, it *can* be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF**

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Y-fum-fcu-MOF is **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane is excluded by size. There is no information on molecules that *can* adsorb, so we can only establish an upper limit for the pore size based on size exclusion.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded by size, 1-pentene is geometrically smaller and can potentially pass through the pores. Based purely on size exclusion, it *can* be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF**

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Y-fum-fcu-MOF is **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane is excluded by size. There is no information on molecules that *can* adsorb, so we can only establish an upper limit for the pore size based on size exclusion.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded by size, trans-2-pentene is geometrically smaller and can potentially pass through the pores. Based purely on size exclusion, it *can* be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: Y-fum-fcu-MOF**

**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
*   Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Y-fum-fcu-MOF is **less than 6.393 Å**, as isobutane is excluded by size. There is no information on molecules that *can* adsorb, so we can only establish an upper limit for the pore size based on size exclusion.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which is excluded by size, n-pentane is geometrically smaller and can potentially pass through the pores. Based purely on size exclusion, it *can* be adsorbed.
