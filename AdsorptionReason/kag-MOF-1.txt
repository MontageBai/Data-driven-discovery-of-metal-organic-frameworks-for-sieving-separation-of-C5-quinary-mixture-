MOF Name: kag-MOF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for kag-MOF-1:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å** | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = **6.762 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Toluene: 8.117×6.501×3.750 → Intermediate = **6.501 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Xylene: 7.487×7.317×3.961 → Intermediate = **7.317 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of kag-MOF-1:
The MOF adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of kag-MOF-1 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å** (i.e., 3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by kag-MOF-1.
