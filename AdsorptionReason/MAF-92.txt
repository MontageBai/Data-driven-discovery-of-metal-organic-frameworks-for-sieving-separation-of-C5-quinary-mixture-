MOF Name: MAF-92
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-92 is greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of adsorbed CO2 (3.200 Å) and less than the intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed methane (3.877 Å). Thus, the effective pore size lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of MAF-92's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-92 due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MAF-92
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-92 is greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of adsorbed CO2 (3.200 Å) and less than the intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed methane (3.877 Å). Thus, the effective pore size lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of MAF-92's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-92 due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MAF-92
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-92 is greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of adsorbed CO2 (3.200 Å) and less than the intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed methane (3.877 Å). Thus, the effective pore size lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of MAF-92's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-92 due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MAF-92
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-92 is greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of adsorbed CO2 (3.200 Å) and less than the intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed methane (3.877 Å). Thus, the effective pore size lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of MAF-92's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-92 due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: MAF-92
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (CH4): 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MAF-92 is greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of adsorbed CO2 (3.200 Å) and less than the intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed methane (3.877 Å). Thus, the effective pore size lies in the range of **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper bound of MAF-92's effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MAF-92 due to size exclusion.
Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
