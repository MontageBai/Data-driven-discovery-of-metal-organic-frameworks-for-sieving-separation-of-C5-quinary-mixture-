MOF Name: ZIF-8

**Inferred ZIF-8 Experimental Effective Pore Size at 298 K, 1 bar (based on intermediate dimensions):**

To infer the effective pore size, we examine the provided experimental data for ZIF-8, focusing on adsorption (Yes) and non-adsorption (No) attributed to "Size exclusion" at conditions close to 298 K and 1 bar. The "intermediate size" of the molecule is the primary concern for pore passage.

**Relevant Adsorbed Molecules (Yes) and their Intermediate Dimensions:**
*   **Propylene:** 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å (intermediate = 5.051 Å). Adsorbed (Yes) at 303 K, 1.0 bar (Kinetic sieving) and 35 °C.
*   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å (intermediate = 4.047 Å). Adsorbed (Yes) at 298 K, 1 bar.
*   **Ethane:** 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å (intermediate = 4.175 Å). Adsorbed (Yes) at 298 K, 1 bar.
*   **Isobutane:** 6.404×6.393×4.866 Å (intermediate = 6.393 Å). Adsorbed (Yes) at 35 °C. (Note: 35 °C is slightly higher than 298 K, but still near ambient).
*   **Benzene:** 7.134×6.762×3.200 Å (intermediate = 6.762 Å). Adsorbed (Yes) at Room temperature, 1 bar. (Note: There is also a contradictory "No" for benzene at Room temperature, vapor phase).

**Relevant Non-Adsorbed Molecules (No) due to Size Exclusion and their Intermediate Dimensions (at or near 298 K, 1 bar):**
*   **3-methylpentane:** 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å (intermediate = 6.008 Å). Not adsorbed (No) at 298 K, 1 bar due to "Size exclusion". This is a crucial data point as it's an explicit rejection at the target conditions.
*   **Toluene:** 8.117×6.501×3.750 Å (intermediate = 6.501 Å). Not adsorbed (No) at 25 °C and Room temperature (vapor phase) due to "Size exclusion". (Note: There is also a contradictory "Yes" for toluene, but the "No" entries are more specific regarding conditions).
*   **2,2-dimethylbutane:** 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å (intermediate = 6.545 Å). Not adsorbed (No) at 298 K due to "Size exclusion".
*   **Cyclohexane:** 6.949×7.090×4.855 Å (intermediate = 6.949 Å). Not adsorbed (No) at Room temperature, 1 bar due to "Size exclusion".

**Synthesizing the Effective Pore Size:**
The experimental data for ZIF-8 indicates a flexible framework with a pore size that can vary depending on the guest molecule and precise conditions (gate-opening effect). This leads to some apparent contradictions when applying a single, fixed intermediate dimension cutoff.

However, based on the explicit "No" for **3-methylpentane (intermediate 6.008 Å)** at 298 K, 1 bar due to "Size exclusion," this sets a strong upper limit for molecules that cannot pass under these conditions. If a molecule with an intermediate dimension of 6.008 Å is excluded, then the effective pore size for general molecular shapes under these conditions must be **less than 6.008 Å**.

We acknowledge that larger molecules like isobutane (6.393 Å) and benzene (6.762 Å) are reported as adsorbed under conditions close to 298 K, 1 bar. This suggests that the ZIF-8 pore can exhibit flexibility (gate-opening) for certain molecules, potentially due to their specific shapes (e.g., planar benzene) or at slightly elevated temperatures (e.g., 35°C for isobutane). However, to maintain consistency with the most direct "Size exclusion" rejection at 298 K, 1 bar for a non-aromatic, branched alkane (3-methylpentane), we infer the general effective pore size to be below 6.008 Å.

Therefore, for the purpose of this evaluation, we will use **< 6.008 Å** as the effective pore size threshold for ZIF-8 at 298 K, 1 bar, particularly for non-planar/branched molecules.

**Guest Molecules to Evaluate (at 298 K and 1 bar):**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**
