For the purpose of the pores passing through, the main concern is the intermediate size of the molecule, that is, among the three sizes, the size is the intermediate size.

**MOF Name: IRMOF-1**

**Inference of IRMOF-1's Effective Pore Size:**

Based on the provided experimental data:

*   **Molecules explicitly adsorbed ("Yes") by IRMOF-1 and their intermediate dimensions:**
    *   Krypton: 3.680×3.680×3.680 → Intermediate = **3.680 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   Xenon: 4.320×4.320×4.320 → Intermediate = **4.320 Å** | Adsorbed (Explicit "Yes" entry)
    *   Ethylbenzene: 9.426×6.501×4.703 → Intermediate = **6.501 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   Toluene: 8.117×6.501×3.750 → Intermediate = **6.501 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = **6.762 Å** | Adsorbed

*   **Molecules stated as "Not Reported" in adsorption but with "Size exclusion" as reason:**
    *   Xenon: 4.320×4.320×4.320 → Intermediate = **4.320 Å** | Not Reported, Reason: Size exclusion
    *   Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = **2.860 Å** | Not Reported, Reason: Size exclusion
    *   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å** | Not Reported, Reason: Size exclusion

**Assessment of Inconsistency:**
The data presents an inconsistency. Xenon is explicitly listed as "Yes" (adsorbed) in one entry (intermediate 4.320 Å), but in another, its adsorption is "Not Reported" with "Size exclusion" as the reason. Furthermore, Oxygen (2.860 Å) and Carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which are smaller than several explicitly adsorbed molecules (e.g., Methane 3.877 Å, Krypton 3.680 Å, and the explicitly adsorbed Xenon 4.320 Å), are also stated as "Not Reported" with "Size exclusion" as a reason. If size exclusion truly prevented their adsorption, then larger molecules like Benzene (6.762 Å) could not be adsorbed.

**Conclusion for Pore Size Inference:**
Given these contradictions, particularly the explicit "Yes" for Xenon and the fact that IRMOF-1 is known for large pores, the "Not Reported" entries with "Size exclusion" for smaller molecules (Xenon, Oxygen, CO2) are considered unreliable for defining an upper size exclusion limit. We will prioritize the explicit "Yes" entries.

Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of IRMOF-1 is at least **6.762 Å** (the largest intermediate dimension of an experimentally adsorbed molecule). There is no consistent experimental data point provided to establish a reliable upper limit for non-adsorption based solely on size exclusion.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: IRMOF-1**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by IRMOF-1 is Benzene, with an intermediate dimension of **6.762 Å**.
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**.
Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of molecules experimentally shown to be adsorbed by IRMOF-1 (Benzene, 6.762 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed. The provided data does not indicate kinetic sieving behavior for molecules in this size range that would prevent adsorption.
