MOF Name: ZIF-108
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Determine based on provided data.

Detailed Reasoning:
From the experimental data for ZIF-108:
- ZIF-108, carbon dioxide, Yes, "Electrochemical reduction facilitated by ligand active sites"

The provided experimental data for ZIF-108 describes an electrochemical process where carbon dioxide is involved in a reduction reaction facilitated by the MOF's ligand active sites, under specific electrochemical conditions (-1.3 V vs. RHE, CO2-saturated solution). This mechanism is explicitly stated as "Electrochemical reduction" and "ligand active sites," not physical adsorption governed by pore size via size exclusion or kinetic sieving.

Therefore, this data point cannot be used to infer the MOF's effective pore size for gas adsorption based on the size exclusion principle, which is the fundamental criterion for this task. Without experimental adsorption data that demonstrates size exclusion or kinetic sieving effects for ZIF-108, it is impossible to apply the "Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size" step as outlined in the task's judgment criteria.

Conclusion:
As the provided experimental data for ZIF-108 does not pertain to physical gas adsorption or size exclusion phenomena, its effective pore size cannot be inferred from the given information. Consequently, a prediction for the adsorption of isoprene (Intermediate dimension: 6.093 Å) based on size compatibility cannot be made.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Determine based on provided data.**
