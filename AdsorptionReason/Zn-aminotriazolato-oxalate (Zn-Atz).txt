To determine the adsorption capability of Zn-aminotriazolato-oxalate (Zn-Atz) for the specified guest molecules, we will first infer the MOF's effective pore size based on the provided experimental data.

**1. Inferring Zn-Atz’s Effective Pore Size:**

*   **Experimental Data for Zn-Atz:**
    *   Molecule: carbon dioxide (CO2)
    *   Dimensions: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å
    *   Intermediate Dimension: 3.200 Å
    *   Adsorbed: Yes

From this, we know that Zn-Atz has pores large enough to accommodate molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å.
However, no data for non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion is provided. Therefore, an upper bound for the MOF's effective pore size cannot be precisely defined from the given information. We can only conclude that the effective pore size is >= 3.200 Å.

**2. Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

We will now evaluate each target molecule by comparing its intermediate dimension with the inferred pore characteristics of Zn-Atz. Given that only a lower bound for pore size can be inferred (3.200 Å), and the target molecules are all larger than this, the prediction will be based on the principle that if a molecule's intermediate dimension is significantly larger than the largest known adsorbed molecule (3.200 Å), and no experimental data supports adsorption for such larger molecules, it is unlikely to be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: Zn-aminotriazolato-oxalate (Zn-Atz)**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Atz is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. No upper limit for the effective pore size can be inferred from the provided data as no molecule was shown to be excluded due to size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Zn-Atz in the provided data. Based on the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, and the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is predicted that Zn-Atz cannot adsorb isoprene. The condition for "Can Adsorb" (molecule intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

**MOF Name: Zn-aminotriazolato-oxalate (Zn-Atz)**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Atz is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. No upper limit for the effective pore size can be inferred from the provided data as no molecule was shown to be excluded due to size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Zn-Atz in the provided data. Based on the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, and the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is predicted that Zn-Atz cannot adsorb cis-2-pentene. The condition for "Can Adsorb" (molecule intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

**MOF Name: Zn-aminotriazolato-oxalate (Zn-Atz)**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Atz is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. No upper limit for the effective pore size can be inferred from the provided data as no molecule was shown to be excluded due to size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Zn-Atz in the provided data. Based on the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, and the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is predicted that Zn-Atz cannot adsorb 1-pentene. The condition for "Can Adsorb" (molecule intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

**MOF Name: Zn-aminotriazolato-oxalate (Zn-Atz)**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Atz is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. No upper limit for the effective pore size can be inferred from the provided data as no molecule was shown to be excluded due to size.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Zn-Atz in the provided data. Based on the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, and the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is predicted that Zn-Atz cannot adsorb trans-2-pentene. The condition for "Can Adsorb" (molecule intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Atz is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. No upper limit for the effective pore size can be inferred from the provided data as no molecule was shown to be excluded due to size.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
The intermediate dimension of n-pentane (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Zn-Atz in the provided data. Based on the principle of size exclusion in MOFs, and the lack of experimental data supporting the adsorption of molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it is predicted that Zn-Atz cannot adsorb n-pentane. The condition for "Can Adsorb" (molecule intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed) is not met.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
