MOF Name: CALF-35 (La3+)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CALF-35 (La3+):
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Acetylene (5.538×3.200×3.200): Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918): Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)
- Ethylene (4.679×4.047×3.200): Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Conditional (Size exclusion, implies difficult passage/non-passage)
- Ethane (4.731×4.175×4.170): Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of CALF-35 (La3+):
Based on the experimental data, molecules with intermediate dimensions of 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide, acetylene) are adsorbed, while molecules with intermediate dimensions of 3.877 Å (methane) and larger (ethylene, ethane) are not adsorbed or are conditionally adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of CALF-35 (La3+) lies between **3.200 Å** (inclusive) and **3.877 Å** (exclusive).

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of CALF-35 (La3+) (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.
