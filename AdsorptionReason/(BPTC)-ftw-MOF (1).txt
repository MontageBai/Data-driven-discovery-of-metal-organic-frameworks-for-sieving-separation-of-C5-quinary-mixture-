MOF Name: (BPTC)-ftw-MOF (1)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for (BPTC)-ftw-MOF (1):
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

The MOF’s inferred effective pore size is derived from the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules and the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion).
- Max intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules: 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide)
- Min intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules: 3.877 Å (methane)

Thus, the inferred effective pore size of (BPTC)-ftw-MOF (1) lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å** (exclusive of 3.877 Å), meaning it can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to approximately 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by (BPTC)-ftw-MOF (1) due to size exclusion.
