MOF Name: Milli-Zn-ATA

**Detailed Analysis of Milli-Zn-ATA's Adsorption Behavior:**

From the provided experimental data for Milli-Zn-ATA:

*   **Propylene:** 6.257×5.051×3.961. The intermediate dimension is **5.051 Å**.
    *   Result: Adsorbed (Yes)
    *   Reason/Mechanism: Kinetic sieving

*   **Propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970. The intermediate dimension is **4.354 Å**.
    *   Result: Not Adsorbed (No)
    *   Reason/Mechanism: Size exclusion

**Inferred Effective Pore Size (Addressing Contradiction):**

Strictly following the inference rule provided ("Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of the adsorbed molecules" AND "Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of the non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion)"), we encounter a contradiction for Milli-Zn-ATA:

*   Largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecule (propylene): 5.051 Å
*   Smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecule (propane by size exclusion): 4.354 Å

This would imply an effective pore size range of [5.051 Å, 4.354 Å), which is mathematically impossible. This suggests that for Milli-Zn-ATA, the simple "intermediate dimension" rule might not universally apply due to specific molecular shapes or pore complexities.

However, based on the provided data, we can infer the following:
1.  The MOF's pores are demonstrably large enough to allow molecules with an intermediate dimension of **5.051 Å** (propylene) to pass, albeit potentially via kinetic sieving (implying a tight fit or shape-dependent passage).
2.  The MOF's pores are *not* large enough to allow molecules with an intermediate dimension of **4.354 Å** (propane) to pass, specifically due to "size exclusion". This is a key observation, suggesting that for *alkane* molecules around this size, the pore's effective opening is smaller than their intermediate dimension, or their specific shape (e.g., more flexible, less planar) leads to exclusion.

Therefore, for prediction, we will consider:
*   Molecules with intermediate dimensions significantly larger than the adsorbed propylene (5.051 Å) are unlikely to adsorb.
*   Molecules with intermediate dimensions similar to or smaller than the excluded propane (4.354 Å), particularly alkanes, are also unlikely to adsorb due to the observed size exclusion.
*   Molecules with intermediate dimensions between these values, especially non-alkanes, might adsorb similar to propylene.

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

*   Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963
*   Intermediate Dimension: **6.093 Å**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of propylene (5.051 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Milli-Zn-ATA. Therefore, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

*   Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136
*   Intermediate Dimension: **5.572 Å**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of propylene (5.051 Å), which is the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed by Milli-Zn-ATA. Therefore, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

*   Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.995 Å**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly smaller than that of propylene (5.051 Å), which is adsorbed by Milli-Zn-ATA (via kinetic sieving). Although propane (4.354 Å) is excluded, 1-pentene, being an alkene like propylene and having a larger intermediate dimension, is more likely to behave similarly to propylene and therefore can be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

*   Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.733 Å**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than that of propylene (5.051 Å), which is adsorbed by Milli-Zn-ATA (via kinetic sieving). Although propane (4.354 Å) is excluded, trans-2-pentene, being an alkene like propylene and having a larger intermediate dimension, is more likely to behave similarly to propylene and therefore can be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

*   Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969
*   Intermediate Dimension: **4.364 Å**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is extremely close to that of propane (4.354 Å). Propane, an alkane like n-pentane, was explicitly excluded by "size exclusion" by Milli-Zn-ATA. Given the similar molecular type and intermediate dimension, it is highly probable that n-pentane will also be excluded by size.
