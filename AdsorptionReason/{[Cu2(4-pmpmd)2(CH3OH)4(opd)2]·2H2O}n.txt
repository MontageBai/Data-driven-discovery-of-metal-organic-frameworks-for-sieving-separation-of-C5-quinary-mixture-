MOF Name: {[Cu2(4-pmpmd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2]·2H2O}n
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for {[Cu2(4-pmpmd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2]·2H2O}n:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 → Intermediate = 6.762 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of {[Cu2(4-pmpmd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2]·2H2O}n allows molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 6.762 Å. Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is **[3.200 Å, 6.762 Å)**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range ([3.200 Å, 6.762 Å)), it is predicted to be able to be adsorbed by {[Cu2(4-pmpmd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2]·2H2O}n.
