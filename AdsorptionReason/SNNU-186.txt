MOF Name: SNNU-186

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of SNNU-186:**

Based on the provided experimental adsorption data:
*   **Methane**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **Ethane**: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = **4.175 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **Propane**: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = **4.354 Å** | Conditional (at 298 K, 1 bar)

From this data, we can infer that SNNU-186 can reliably adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to at least 4.175 Å. The "Conditional" status for propane (4.354 Å) under the same standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar) indicates that propane's passage is highly restricted, possibly due to a very tight fit leading to strong kinetic sieving, or that it adsorbs but not efficiently or universally. This "Conditional" behavior defines the practical upper limit for reliable adsorption under these conditions. Molecules with an intermediate dimension equal to or slightly larger than 4.354 Å are likely to be excluded or face significant barriers to adsorption. Therefore, the effective pore size for reliable passage is around 4.175 Å, and passage becomes severely hindered or impossible for molecules with intermediate dimensions at or above ~4.354 Å.

**Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: SNNU-186**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   Comparison: The intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å), which was only conditionally adsorbed by SNNU-186, and also significantly larger than ethane (4.175 Å) which was fully adsorbed.
*   Conclusion: Due to its much larger size compared to the effective pore threshold of SNNU-186, isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
*   Comparison: The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å), which was only conditionally adsorbed by SNNU-186, and also significantly larger than ethane (4.175 Å) which was fully adsorbed.
*   Conclusion: Due to its much larger size compared to the effective pore threshold of SNNU-186, cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
*   Comparison: The intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å), which was only conditionally adsorbed by SNNU-186, and also significantly larger than ethane (4.175 Å) which was fully adsorbed.
*   Conclusion: Due to its much larger size compared to the effective pore threshold of SNNU-186, 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: SNNU-186**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
*   Comparison: The intermediate dimension of trans-2-pentene (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å), which was only conditionally adsorbed by SNNU-186, and also significantly larger than ethane (4.175 Å) which was fully adsorbed.
*   Conclusion: Due to its larger size compared to the effective pore threshold of SNNU-186, trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: SNNU-186**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**
*   Comparison: The intermediate dimension of n-pentane (4.364 Å) is very close to and slightly larger than the intermediate dimension of propane (4.354 Å), which was only conditionally adsorbed by SNNU-186 at standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar). Since propane already faces significant kinetic hindrance or partial exclusion, n-pentane, being slightly larger, is highly unlikely to be adsorbed under the same standard conditions.
*   Conclusion: Given the "Conditional" status of propane due to its size being at the effective pore limit, n-pentane, with an intermediate dimension that is equal to or marginally larger, would likely face even stronger size exclusion or kinetic sieving effects, rendering adsorption under standard conditions impractical or impossible.
