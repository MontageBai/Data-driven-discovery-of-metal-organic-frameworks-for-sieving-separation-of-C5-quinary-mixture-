MOF Name: Zn-BPZ

**Analysis of Experimental Data for Zn-BPZ:**

The provided experimental data for Zn-BPZ shows the following:

*   **hexane:** 10.359×4.607×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Can Pass Sieving: No | Reason: Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers
*   **2-methylpentane:** 9.023×6.376×4.923 → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Can Pass Sieving: No | Reason: Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers
*   **3-methylpentane:** 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Can Pass Sieving: No | Reason: Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers
*   **2,2-dimethylbutane:** 7.829×6.545×5.502 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Can Pass Sieving: No | Reason: Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers
*   **2,3-dimethylbutane:** 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = 6.170 Å | Can Pass Sieving: No | Reason: Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers

**Inferred Effective Pore Size and Adsorption Mechanism:**

Based on the prompt's guidelines, an effective pore size can be inferred for size exclusion. However, for Zn-BPZ, all experimental entries state "No" for "Can Pass Sieving," and the reason given is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers," *not* "size exclusion."

"Non-constricted diffusion" implies that the MOF's pores are geometrically large enough for these molecules to pass through easily without steric hindrance. Therefore, the "No" for "Can Pass Sieving" does not indicate a blockage due to size exclusion. Instead, it suggests that the MOF *fails to effectively adsorb or separate* these molecules via a sieving mechanism because they pass through too freely or do not exhibit differential diffusion/adsorption strong enough for separation.

From the provided data, the largest intermediate dimension among the "non-adsorbed" hexane isomers is 6.545 Å (2,2-dimethylbutane). If these molecules undergo "non-constricted diffusion," it indicates that the effective pore size of Zn-BPZ is likely *larger than* 6.545 Å, allowing these molecules to freely enter and pass through without significant retention or selective adsorption.

**Conclusion for Target Molecules:**

Given that all listed hexane isomers (with intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are experimentally noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion," it is highly probable that other molecules of comparable or smaller intermediate dimensions will also experience similar non-constricted diffusion, leading to a "Cannot Adsorb" outcome in the context of effective adsorption/sieving.

MOF Name: Zn-BPZ
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BPZ:
- All hexane isomers (intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" (i.e., not effectively adsorbed/sieved).
- The reason provided for this non-adsorption is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers." This implies that the MOF's pores are large enough for these molecules to pass through freely, but they are not effectively retained or separated by a sieving mechanism.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) falls within the range of the hexane isomers that are experimentally determined to be "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion." Since molecules of similar or larger size are not effectively adsorbed by this mechanism, it is predicted that isoprene will also not be effectively adsorbed by Zn-BPZ.

MOF Name: Zn-BPZ
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BPZ:
- All hexane isomers (intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" (i.e., not effectively adsorbed/sieved).
- The reason provided for this non-adsorption is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers." This implies that the MOF's pores are large enough for these molecules to pass through freely, but they are not effectively retained or separated by a sieving mechanism.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) falls within the range of the hexane isomers that are experimentally determined to be "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion." Since molecules of similar or larger size are not effectively adsorbed by this mechanism, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene will also not be effectively adsorbed by Zn-BPZ.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BPZ:
- All hexane isomers (intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" (i.e., not effectively adsorbed/sieved).
- The reason provided for this non-adsorption is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers." This implies that the MOF's pores are large enough for these molecules to pass through freely, but they are not effectively retained or separated by a sieving mechanism.

1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the range of the hexane isomers that are experimentally determined to be "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion." Since molecules of similar or larger size are not effectively adsorbed by this mechanism, it is predicted that 1-pentene will also not be effectively adsorbed by Zn-BPZ.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BPZ:
- All hexane isomers (intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" (i.e., not effectively adsorbed/sieved).
- The reason provided for this non-adsorption is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers." This implies that the MOF's pores are large enough for these molecules to pass through freely, but they are not effectively retained or separated by a sieving mechanism.

- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is very close to or falls within the range of the hexane isomers (e.g., hexane at 4.607 Å) that are experimentally determined to be "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion." Since molecules of similar or larger size are not effectively adsorbed by this mechanism, it is predicted that trans-2-pentene will also not be effectively adsorbed by Zn-BPZ.

MOF Name: Zn-BPZ
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-BPZ:
- All hexane isomers (intermediate dimensions ranging from 4.607 Å to 6.545 Å) are noted as "Cannot Pass Sieving" (i.e., not effectively adsorbed/sieved).
- The reason provided for this non-adsorption is "Non-constricted diffusion of all hexane isomers." This implies that the MOF's pores are large enough for these molecules to pass through freely, but they are not effectively retained or separated by a sieving mechanism.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the smallest intermediate dimension of the tested hexane isomers (hexane, 4.607 Å) which are experimentally determined to be "Cannot Pass Sieving" due to "Non-constricted diffusion." Since molecules of larger size are not effectively adsorbed by this mechanism (implying pores are too large for effective sieving/retention), it is predicted that n-pentane will also not be effectively adsorbed by Zn-BPZ under similar conditions.
