Based on the provided experimental data and molecular size information, here is the assessment for MOF-5 and the specified guest molecules:

First, let's analyze the experimental data for MOF-5 to infer its effective pore size:

**Experimental Adsorption Data for MOF-5:**

*   **Carbon dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.200 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **Methane:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.877 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)

**Inferred MOF-5 Effective Pore Size:**

*   The largest intermediate dimension of molecules known to be adsorbed by MOF-5 is **3.877 Å** (Methane).
*   No experimental data is provided for any molecules that were *not* adsorbed by MOF-5 due to size exclusion. Therefore, based solely on the provided data, no upper limit for MOF-5's effective pore size can be determined.
*   This implies that MOF-5's effective pore size is inferred to be **greater than or equal to 3.877 Å**, with no upper bound established by the provided size exclusion data.

Now, let's evaluate each target guest molecule:
