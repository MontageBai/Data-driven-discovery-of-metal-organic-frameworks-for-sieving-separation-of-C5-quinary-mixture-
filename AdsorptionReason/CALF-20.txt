MOF Name: CALF-20
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
- No molecules are explicitly listed as *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion in the provided data.

Inferred effective pore size of CALF-20: CALF-20 is confirmed to adsorb carbon dioxide, which has an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. The stated adsorption mechanism for carbon dioxide is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," implying that the material's pores are size-selective. However, since no molecules are listed as being *excluded* due to size, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be definitively established from the provided data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
While an exact upper bound for CALF-20's pore size cannot be determined from the given experimental data, the only molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide. Given the "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" mechanism for CO2 adsorption, it is highly probable that CALF-20's pores are too restrictive to accommodate molecules substantially larger than carbon dioxide. Therefore, based on the principle of size exclusion inferred from the available data, isoprene is predicted to be unable to adsorb.
