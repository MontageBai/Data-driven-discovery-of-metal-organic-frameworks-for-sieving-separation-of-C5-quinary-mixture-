MOF Name: Zr-FA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zr-FA:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zr-FA:
Based on the experimental data, Zr-FA allows carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) to pass but excludes methane (intermediate 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of Zr-FA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å, i.e., it lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target guest molecule dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of Zr-FA's inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zr-FA due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zr-FA
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zr-FA:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zr-FA:
Based on the experimental data, Zr-FA allows carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) to pass but excludes methane (intermediate 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of Zr-FA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å, i.e., it lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target guest molecule dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of Zr-FA's inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zr-FA due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zr-FA
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zr-FA:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zr-FA:
Based on the experimental data, Zr-FA allows carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) to pass but excludes methane (intermediate 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of Zr-FA is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å, i.e., it lies in the range [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

Target guest molecule dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of Zr-FA's inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zr-FA due to size exclusion.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zr-FA:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of Zr-FA's inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zr-FA due to size exclusion.
