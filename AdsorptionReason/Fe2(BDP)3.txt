MOF Name: Fe2(bdp)3
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Fe2(bdp)3:
- Hexane: 10.359×4.607×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed
- 2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorbed
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed

The MOF Fe2(bdp)3 has been shown to adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 6.545 Å (2,2-dimethylbutane). There are no reported non-adsorbed molecules due to size exclusion in the provided data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (2,2-dimethylbutane, 6.545 Å), it is highly likely that isoprene can be adsorbed by Fe2(bdp)3. The experimental data suggests thermodynamic separation, implying the pores are sufficiently large for passage.
