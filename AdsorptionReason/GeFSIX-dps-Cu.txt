MOF Name: GeFSIX-dps-Cu
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for GeFSIX-dps-Cu:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of GeFSIX-dps-Cu:
The MOF successfully adsorbs propyne (intermediate dimension 3.961 Å) and acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). However, it rejects ethylene (intermediate dimension 4.047 Å) due to size exclusion. This indicates that the effective pore aperture of GeFSIX-dps-Cu is larger than 3.961 Å but smaller than 4.047 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by GeFSIX-dps-Cu due to size exclusion.
