MOF Name: Cu-Tria
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Cu-Tria:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu-Tria:
The MOF adsorbs carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å). It does not adsorb ethylene (intermediate 4.047 Å) or propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size of Cu-Tria lies between **3.200 Å and 4.047 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å but excludes those with intermediate dimensions ≥ 4.047 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Cu-Tria due to size exclusion.
