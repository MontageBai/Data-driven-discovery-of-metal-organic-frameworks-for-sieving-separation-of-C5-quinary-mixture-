To determine the adsorption capability of GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i for the specified guest molecules, we will follow the outlined reasoning steps based on the provided experimental data and molecular probe sizes.

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i:
*   **Adsorbed (Yes) molecules:**
    *   **Propane:** 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate dimension = **4.354 Å**
    *   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = **4.047 Å**
*   **Non-adsorbed (No due to size exclusion) molecules:** No data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Based on the adsorbed molecules, the largest intermediate dimension observed to be adsorbed is 4.354 Å (for propane). Therefore, we can infer that the effective pore size of GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i is **at least 4.354 Å**.

Since no molecules are reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be precisely determined from the provided experimental data alone. This implies that the pore could potentially be larger than 4.354 Å. However, for the purpose of strict size exclusion judgment in the absence of an explicit upper bound, if a molecule's intermediate dimension exceeds the largest empirically confirmed adsorbed size, it is generally considered unable to pass unless further evidence suggests otherwise.

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

Let's extract the intermediate dimensions for the target guest molecules:
*   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate dimension = **6.093 Å**
*   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate dimension = **5.572 Å**
*   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate dimension = **4.995 Å**
*   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate dimension = **4.733 Å**
*   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate dimension = **4.364 Å**

**3. Comprehensive Judgment:**

The MOF GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i is experimentally shown to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.354 Å (propane). All the target guest molecules have intermediate dimensions larger than 4.354 Å.

Since the provided experimental data does not include any molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, we cannot establish a definitive upper limit for the MOF's pore size based on experimental non-adsorption. However, the rule for "Can Adsorb" states "If molecule’s intermediate dimension ≤ max_intermediate_adsorbed". None of the target molecules meet this criterion.

In the absence of a kinetic sieving mechanism being explicitly mentioned for the adsorbed molecules, and given that the target molecules are all larger than the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed, the most conservative interpretation based on the size exclusion principle (which dictates a maximum pore diameter) is that these larger molecules are likely too large to be adsorbed. Without experimental evidence of adsorption for molecules larger than 4.354 Å, or an explicit pore size determination, it cannot be definitively concluded that these larger molecules *can* be adsorbed based solely on the provided data and the size exclusion principle.

**Evaluations:**

**MOF Name: GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i:
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension for an experimentally adsorbed molecule is 4.354 Å (propane). This implies the effective pore size of GaFFIVE-5-Cd-i is at least 4.354 Å. No experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so an explicit upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be precisely determined from the provided data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (propane, 4.354 Å). As per the defined judgment criteria, if the target molecule's intermediate dimension is not less than or equal to the maximum adsorbed intermediate dimension, and no other data supports its adsorption, it cannot be definitively concluded that it *can* be adsorbed based solely on the size exclusion principle. Therefore, it is predicted that it **cannot Adsorb**.
