MOF Name: Zn-SDBA-bpy
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-SDBA-bpy:
-   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes), primarily due to "Selective gate-opening for acetylene due to strong C2H2-host interactions and framework flexibility". This implies the MOF's intrinsic pore size is smaller than 3.200 Å, but it can expand to accommodate this size upon specific interaction.
-   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (No), due to "Size exclusion and unfavorable electrostatic interactions". This indicates that without specific interactions that trigger gate-opening (like for acetylene), molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å or larger are size-excluded.

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-SDBA-bpy:
The MOF exhibits a gate-opening phenomenon for acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å). However, carbon dioxide, with the same intermediate dimension (3.200 Å), is *not* adsorbed due to "size exclusion" and unfavorable interactions. This strongly suggests that the MOF's pore is effectively smaller than 3.200 Å in its default state, and it only opens for specific molecules like acetylene. Therefore, for general adsorption, molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å or greater are likely to be size-excluded unless they possess unique properties to induce a highly specific framework expansion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than 3.200 Å (the intermediate dimension of CO2, which is size-excluded) and also significantly larger than acetylene (3.200 Å), which requires a specific gate-opening mechanism for adsorption. There is no indication that Zn-SDBA-bpy would exhibit such a large and specific expansion for a molecule of this size. Therefore, isoprene is predicted to be too large for adsorption by Zn-SDBA-bpy.
