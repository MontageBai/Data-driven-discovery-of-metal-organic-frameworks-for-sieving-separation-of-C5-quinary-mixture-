**Detailed Reasoning for UPC-80's Inferred Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for UPC-80, the following molecules are adsorbed:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.849 Å | Adsorbed (Adsorption Type: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

The largest intermediate dimension among the adsorbed molecules is 5.051 Å (propylene). The experimental data for UPC-80 does not include any molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, based on the provided data, we can infer that the effective pore size of UPC-80 is at least 5.051 Å, allowing molecules with an intermediate dimension up to this value to pass through. The mention of "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" for certain adsorbed molecules (ethane, propylene, propane, methane) indicates that these molecules fit tightly within the pores, defining the practical upper limit of what can be accommodated by the MOF via size exclusion.

**Evaluation for Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: UPC-80**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by UPC-80 is 5.051 Å (propylene). Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than this established upper limit of demonstrated adsorption (5.051 Å), it is unlikely to pass through the MOF's pores due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: UPC-80**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by UPC-80 is 5.051 Å (propylene). Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than this established upper limit of demonstrated adsorption (5.051 Å), it is unlikely to pass through the MOF's pores due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: UPC-80**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by UPC-80 is 5.051 Å (propylene). Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than or equal to this established upper limit of demonstrated adsorption (5.051 Å), it can be adsorbed by UPC-80.

**MOF Name: UPC-80**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by UPC-80 is 5.051 Å (propylene). Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than or equal to this established upper limit of demonstrated adsorption (5.051 Å), it can be adsorbed by UPC-80.

**MOF Name: UPC-80**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by UPC-80 is 5.051 Å (propylene). Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than or equal to this established upper limit of demonstrated adsorption (5.051 Å), it can be adsorbed by UPC-80.
