MOF Name: ZIF-7-8
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-7-8:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-7-8:
Based on the experimental data, ZIF-7-8 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of ZIF-7-8 lies within the range of [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å), primarily operating via size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZIF-7-8
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-7-8:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZIF-7-8:
Based on the experimental data, ZIF-7-8 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of ZIF-7-8 lies within the range of [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å), primarily operating via size exclusion.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZIF-7-8
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-7-8:
- Carbon dioxide (5.198×3.200×3.200) → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane (3.877×3.849×3.918) → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Based on the experimental data, ZIF-7-8 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å (carbon dioxide) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of ZIF-7-8 lies within the range of [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å), primarily operating via size exclusion.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.
