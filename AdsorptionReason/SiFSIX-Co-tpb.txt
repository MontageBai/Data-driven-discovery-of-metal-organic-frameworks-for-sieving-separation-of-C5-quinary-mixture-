To determine the adsorption capability of SiFSIX-Co-tpb for the specified guest molecules, we will first infer its effective pore size from the provided experimental data and then compare it with the intermediate dimensions of the target molecules.

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size (SiFSIX-Co-tpb):**

From the experimental data:
*   **3-methylpentane**: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate dimension = **6.008 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **2,2-dimethylbutane**: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate dimension = **6.545 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes)

Since both 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å) and 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å) are adsorbed by SiFSIX-Co-tpb, the MOF's effective pore size must be at least **6.545 Å** (the largest intermediate dimension among the adsorbed molecules). There is no data provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, so we can only establish a lower bound for the effective pore size.

**Inferred effective pore size of SiFSIX-Co-tpb ≥ 6.545 Å.**

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

We will now compare the intermediate dimension of each target molecule with the inferred effective pore size of SiFSIX-Co-tpb.

MOF Name: SiFSIX-Co-tpb
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for SiFSIX-Co-tpb:
*   3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
*   2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of SiFSIX-Co-tpb is at least **6.545 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of molecules known to be adsorbed by SiFSIX-Co-tpb (6.545 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
