MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]

Detailed Reasoning for General Behavior:
From the experimental data provided for [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]:
*   **Propylene** (dimensions: 6.257×5.051×3.961 Å) -> Intermediate dimension = **5.051 Å**. It was **adsorbed (Yes)**, with the adsorption type specified as "Gate-opening adsorption."
*   **Propane** (dimensions: 6.552×4.354×3.970 Å) -> Intermediate dimension = **4.354 Å**. It was **not adsorbed (No)**, due to "Size exclusion."

**Inconsistency Analysis:**
According to the problem's rule for inferring effective pore size: "Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of the adsorbed molecules" and "Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of the non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion)."
*   Largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules = 5.051 Å (Propylene).
*   Smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules = 4.354 Å (Propane).

This implies an inferred effective pore size range of [5.051 Å, 4.354 Å), which is an impossible (empty) range. This directly contradicts the premise that a simple size exclusion effect based *solely* on the intermediate dimension governs all adsorption behavior for this MOF.

**Conclusion from Inconsistency:**
The experimental data for [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)] indicates a more complex adsorption mechanism than a simple size exclusion based on intermediate dimension alone. Specifically, Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is excluded, while Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å, which is larger) is adsorbed via gate-opening. This suggests that the MOF's selectivity is highly dependent on molecular shape, unsaturation (alkene vs. alkane), flexibility, and specific interactions that trigger the gate-opening mechanism, rather than a single, universal intermediate dimension cutoff. Propane's "size exclusion" implies that despite its numerically smaller intermediate dimension, it effectively presents a larger critical dimension for this MOF's pores, or it cannot induce the necessary gate-opening.

Given this complexity, predictions will be based on the observed outcomes for propylene and propane, with the understanding that the "intermediate dimension" rule is problematic for a universal cutoff with this MOF.

MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
- MOF's known behavior: Propylene (Intermediate = 5.051 Å) is adsorbed via gate-opening. Propane (Intermediate = 4.354 Å) is not adsorbed due to size exclusion.
- Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**.
- Conclusion: Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), which itself requires gate-opening for adsorption. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that isoprene can be adsorbed by [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)].

MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
- MOF's known behavior: Propylene (Intermediate = 5.051 Å) is adsorbed via gate-opening. Propane (Intermediate = 4.354 Å) is not adsorbed due to size exclusion.
- cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**.
- Conclusion: cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than that of Propylene (5.051 Å), which requires gate-opening for adsorption. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that cis-2-pentene can be adsorbed by [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)].

MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
- MOF's known behavior: Propylene (Intermediate = 5.051 Å) is adsorbed via gate-opening. Propane (Intermediate = 4.354 Å) is not adsorbed due to size exclusion. The intermediate dimension rule for pore size inference leads to a contradiction due to propane's exclusion.
- 1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**.
- Conclusion: 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly smaller than Propylene's (5.051 Å), which is adsorbed via gate-opening. Both are unsaturated alkenes. Given that the MOF exhibits gate-opening behavior for a slightly larger alkene (propylene), it is plausible that 1-pentene, with similar chemical characteristics and a slightly smaller critical dimension, could also induce gate-opening and be adsorbed.

MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
- MOF's known behavior: Propylene (Intermediate = 5.051 Å) is adsorbed via gate-opening. Propane (Intermediate = 4.354 Å) is not adsorbed due to size exclusion. The intermediate dimension rule for pore size inference leads to a contradiction due to propane's exclusion.
- trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**.
- Conclusion: trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls between that of Propane (4.354 Å, not adsorbed due to size exclusion) and Propylene (5.051 Å, adsorbed via gate-opening). While it is an alkene like propylene, its intermediate dimension is considerably closer to propane's value. Given that propane, despite its smaller intermediate dimension, is excluded, it suggests a specific shape/interaction-based exclusion for certain molecules. Without further data on molecules in this ambiguous range, and noting propane's specific exclusion, it is more conservative to predict that trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed, as the gate-opening observed for propylene may be highly specific to its slightly larger size or exact shape.

MOF Name: [Zn2(BDC-Cl)2(Py2TTz)]
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
- MOF's known behavior: Propylene (Intermediate = 5.051 Å) is adsorbed via gate-opening. Propane (Intermediate = 4.354 Å) is not adsorbed due to size exclusion.
- n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**.
- Conclusion: n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is extremely close to, and slightly larger than, Propane's intermediate dimension (4.354 Å). Both are saturated alkanes. Since Propane was explicitly stated to be excluded due to "Size exclusion," it is highly probable that n-pentane, being a larger homologous alkane with a very similar intermediate dimension to the excluded propane, will also be excluded by the MOF.
