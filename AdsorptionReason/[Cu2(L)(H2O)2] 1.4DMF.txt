MOF Name: [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF

**Experimental Adsorption Data for [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF:**
*   **Carbon dioxide (CO2):** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes) | Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale.

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF:**
Based on the experimental data, the MOF can adsorb carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This establishes a lower bound for the effective pore size: the pore size is **at least 3.200 Å**.
Crucially, there is no experimental data provided for any guest molecule that was *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be strictly determined from the given information.

**Judgment Criteria:**
*   If a molecule's intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of known adsorbed molecules, it *can* adsorb.
*   If a molecule's intermediate dimension is greater than or equal to the smallest intermediate dimension of known non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion), it *cannot* adsorb.

Given the absence of an upper bound from "No" data, and strict adherence to the provided rules, if a target molecule's intermediate dimension is *larger* than the largest known adsorbed molecule, we cannot conclude it *can* adsorb as it does not meet the specified 'Can Adsorb' criterion, nor is there evidence of pore size large enough to accommodate it.

**Evaluations:**

**MOF Name: [Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   The MOF `[Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF` is known to adsorb **carbon dioxide** (intermediate dimension: 3.200 Å). The adsorption mechanism is noted as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", implying a size-selective behavior.
*   This indicates that the effective pore size of `[Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF` is at least 3.200 Å.
*   No molecules are reported as *not adsorbed* due to size exclusion in the provided data, so an upper limit for the pore size cannot be directly inferred.
*   **Isoprene** has dimensions of 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 6.093 Å**.
*   Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only confirmed adsorbed molecule (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any experimental evidence or rule indicating adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it cannot be definitively concluded that isoprene can pass through the MOF pores based solely on the provided limited experimental data.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   The MOF `[Cu2(L)(H2O)2] 1.4DMF` is known to adsorb **carbon dioxide** (intermediate dimension: 3.200 Å). The adsorption mechanism is noted as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale", implying a size-selective behavior.

*   **cis-2-pentene** has dimensions of 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å, with an **intermediate dimension of 5.572 Å**.
*   Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only confirmed adsorbed molecule (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and without any experimental evidence or rule indicating adsorption for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, it cannot be definitively concluded that cis-2-pentene can pass through the MOF pores based solely on the provided limited experimental data.
