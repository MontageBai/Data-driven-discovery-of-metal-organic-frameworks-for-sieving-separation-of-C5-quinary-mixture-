MOF Name: MIL-96
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-96:
*   trans-piperylene: 8.735×5.051×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   cis-piperylene: 8.015×5.476×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.476 Å | Adsorbed
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-96: Based on the provided data, MIL-96 is shown to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 6.093 Å (isoprene). No molecules are listed as not being adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be greater than or equal to 6.093 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since the intermediate dimension of isoprene (6.093 Å) is equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule already experimentally confirmed as adsorbed by MIL-96, it is predicted that MIL-96 can adsorb isoprene. The experimental data explicitly states "isoprene,Yes".

MOF Name: MIL-96
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-96:
*   trans-piperylene: 8.735×5.051×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   cis-piperylene: 8.015×5.476×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.476 Å | Adsorbed
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-96: The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 6.093 Å (isoprene). The effective pore size is inferred to be greater than or equal to 6.093 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since the intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule experimentally confirmed as adsorbed by MIL-96 (6.093 Å for isoprene), it is predicted that MIL-96 can adsorb cis-2-pentene based on size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MIL-96:
*   trans-piperylene: 8.735×5.051×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
*   cis-piperylene: 8.015×5.476×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.476 Å | Adsorbed
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MIL-96: The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 6.093 Å (isoprene). The effective pore size is inferred to be greater than or equal to 6.093 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since the intermediate dimension of 1-pentene (4.995 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule experimentally confirmed as adsorbed by MIL-96 (6.093 Å for isoprene), it is predicted that MIL-96 can adsorb 1-pentene based on size exclusion.
