MOF Name: NipzNi
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NipzNi:
- 2-methylpentane (9.023×6.376×4.923) → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorption is Temperature-dependent, indicating it can pass but is a tight fit or subject to kinetic sieving/affinity effects.
- 2,2-dimethylbutane (7.829×6.545×5.502) → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Molecular sieving/Size exclusion).

Inferred effective pore size of NipzNi:
Based on the experimental data, molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.376 Å (2-methylpentane) can pass (though with kinetic/temperature dependence), while molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å (2,2-dimethylbutane) cannot pass due to size exclusion. This infers an effective pore size range for NipzNi: **6.376 Å ≤ Pore Size < 6.545 Å**.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- isoprene (7.746×6.093×3.963) → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the lower bound of the inferred effective pore size (6.376 Å), it should be able to pass through the NipzNi pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
