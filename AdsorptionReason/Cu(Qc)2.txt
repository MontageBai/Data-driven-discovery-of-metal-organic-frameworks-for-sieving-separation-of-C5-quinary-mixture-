MOF Name: Cu(Qc)2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Cu(Qc)2:
*   Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed (Kinetic sieving)
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Cu(Qc)2:
The experimental data indicates that ethylene (intermediate dimension 4.047 Å) is *not* adsorbed due to "Size exclusion." This suggests that the MOF's general effective pore size for geometric passage is effectively less than 4.047 Å.
However, ethane (intermediate dimension 4.175 Å) *is* adsorbed, with the mechanism explicitly stated as "Kinetic sieving." This implies that ethane's adsorption is a specific, tight fit due to its particular shape or interactions, allowing it to pass even though its intermediate dimension is nominally larger than that of ethylene, which is size-excluded.
Given the explicit "Size exclusion" for ethylene, we infer that for general molecules without a specific kinetic sieving pathway, the effective pore size limits passage to dimensions below 4.047 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which is explicitly excluded by size, it is highly unlikely that isoprene can be adsorbed by Cu(Qc)2 without specific kinetic sieving behavior, which is not indicated by the provided data for isoprene.
