MOF Name: [Zn2(L)]·DMF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data provided for [Zn2(L)]·DMF:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Based on this single data point, the inferred effective pore size of [Zn2(L)]·DMF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be precisely inferred from the given data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly confirmed to be adsorbed by this MOF. While the precise upper bound of the MOF's pore size cannot be determined from the available data, given that the MOF operates on a size exclusion principle and that isoprene's dimensions substantially exceed the only confirmed pore passage size, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion. A definitive confirmation would require experimental data on larger molecules that are either adsorbed or excluded by the MOF.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data provided for [Zn2(L)]·DMF:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Based on this single data point, the inferred effective pore size of [Zn2(L)]·DMF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, an upper limit for the effective pore size cannot be precisely inferred from the given data.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly confirmed to be adsorbed by this MOF. While the precise upper bound of the MOF's pore size cannot be determined from the available data, given that the MOF operates on a size exclusion principle and that cis-2-pentene's dimensions substantially exceed the only confirmed pore passage size, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion. A definitive confirmation would require experimental data on larger molecules that are either adsorbed or excluded by the MOF.

Based on this single data point, the inferred effective pore size of [Zn2(L)]·DMF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å.

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule explicitly confirmed to be adsorbed by this MOF. While the precise upper bound of the MOF's pore size cannot be determined from the available data, given that the MOF operates on a size exclusion principle and that 1-pentene's dimensions substantially exceed the only confirmed pore passage size, it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion. A definitive confirmation would require experimental data on larger molecules that are either adsorbed or excluded by the MOF.

Based on this single data point, the inferred effective pore size of [Zn2(L)]·DMF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 3.200 Å.
