MOF Name: NNM-5
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NNM-5:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NNM-5:
The MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 6.008 Å (3-methylpentane) to pass, but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.545 Å (2,2-dimethylbutane). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of NNM-5 lies in the range [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å), meaning it is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of NNM-5 ([6.008 Å, 6.545 Å)). Specifically, it is larger than the largest adsorbed molecule (3-methylpentane, 6.008 Å) but critically, it is smaller than the smallest molecule known to be excluded by size exclusion (2,2-dimethylbutane, 6.545 Å). Since the exclusion mechanism is stated as "Size exclusion," indicating a geometric cut-off, molecules smaller than the excluded one are expected to pass. Therefore, isoprene can be adsorbed by NNM-5.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NNM-5:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NNM-5:
The inferred effective pore size of NNM-5 lies in the range [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å), meaning it is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by NNM-5. Therefore, cis-2-pentene can be adsorbed by NNM-5.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NNM-5:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NNM-5:
The inferred effective pore size of NNM-5 lies in the range [6.008 Å, 6.545 Å), meaning it is greater than or equal to 6.008 Å and less than 6.545 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of 3-methylpentane (6.008 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by NNM-5. Therefore, 1-pentene can be adsorbed by NNM-5.
