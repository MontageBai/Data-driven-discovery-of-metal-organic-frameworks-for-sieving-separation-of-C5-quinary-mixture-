**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**

**Detailed Reasoning for ZU-36-Co's Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for ZU-36-Co:
*   **Adsorbed molecules (intermediate dimensions):**
    *   butane: 7.709×4.532×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.532 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   1-butene: 7.585×4.583×4.535 → Intermediate = **4.583 Å** | Adsorbed
    *   *The largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules is 4.583 Å.*

*   **Non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion, intermediate dimensions):**
    *   isobutene: 6.527×5.566×3.960 → Intermediate = **5.566 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
    *   isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = **6.393 Å** | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
    *   *The smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules is 5.566 Å.*

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Co is greater than or equal to 4.583 Å and strictly less than 5.566 Å.
Thus, the effective pore size ∈ **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.

**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **The MOF’s inferred effective pore size:** ZU-36-Co can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.583 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.566 Å or larger. The inferred pore size range is **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.
*   **Isoprene Dimensions:**
    *   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
*   **Conclusion:** Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of ZU-36-Co's inferred effective pore size (5.566 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-36-Co due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **The MOF’s inferred effective pore size:** ZU-36-Co can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.583 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.566 Å or larger. The inferred pore size range is **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.
*   **cis-2-pentene Dimensions:**
    *   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
*   **Conclusion:** Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the upper bound of ZU-36-Co's inferred effective pore size (5.566 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-36-Co due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **The MOF’s inferred effective pore size:** ZU-36-Co can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.583 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.566 Å or larger. The inferred pore size range is **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.
*   **1-pentene Dimensions:**
    *   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
*   **Conclusion:** Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of ZU-36-Co (4.583 Å ≤ 4.995 Å < 5.566 Å), it can be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**
**Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **The MOF’s inferred effective pore size:** ZU-36-Co can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.583 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.566 Å or larger. The inferred pore size range is **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.
*   **trans-2-pentene Dimensions:**
    *   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
*   **Conclusion:** Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls within the inferred effective pore size range of ZU-36-Co (4.583 Å ≤ 4.733 Å < 5.566 Å), it can be adsorbed.

**MOF Name: ZU-36-Co**
**Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   **The MOF’s inferred effective pore size:** ZU-36-Co can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 4.583 Å but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.566 Å or larger. The inferred pore size range is **[4.583 Å, 5.566 Å)**.
*   **n-pentane Dimensions:**
    *   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**
*   **Conclusion:** Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the smallest intermediate dimension of molecules known to be adsorbed (1-butene at 4.583 Å), it can certainly pass through the pores of ZU-36-Co. Therefore, it can be adsorbed.
