MOF Name: TMOF-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From the provided experimental data for TMOF-1:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- There are no experimental data points provided for TMOF-1 showing a guest molecule that was *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Inferred effective pore size of TMOF-1: Based on the adsorption of carbon dioxide, the effective pore size of TMOF-1 is inferred to be **at least 3.200 Å**. Since no molecules are reported as failing to adsorb due to size exclusion, an upper bound for the pore size based on a size exclusion cutoff cannot be established from the provided experimental data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the established lower bound of TMOF-1's pore size (3.200 Å). However, in the absence of experimental data that defines an upper size exclusion limit for TMOF-1's pores, it cannot be concluded from the provided data that isoprene is too large to pass through the pores. Therefore, based solely on the available size exclusion information which does not provide contradictory evidence, it is predicted that isoprene can be adsorbed.

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the established lower bound of TMOF-1's pore size (3.200 Å). However, in the absence of experimental data that defines an upper size exclusion limit for TMOF-1's pores, it cannot be concluded from the provided data that cis-2-pentene is too large to pass through the pores. Therefore, based solely on the available size exclusion information which does not provide contradictory evidence, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene can be adsorbed.

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the established lower bound of TMOF-1's pore size (3.200 Å). However, in the absence of experimental data that defines an upper size exclusion limit for TMOF-1's pores, it cannot be concluded from the provided data that 1-pentene is too large to pass through the pores. Therefore, based solely on the available size exclusion information which does not provide contradictory evidence, it is predicted that 1-pentene can be adsorbed.
