To determine whether NH2-MIL-101(Fe) can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we first infer its effective pore size based on the provided experimental adsorption data and the known kinetic diameters of the molecules.

**1. Inferring NH2-MIL-101(Fe)’s Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data for NH2-MIL-101(Fe):
*   **Carbon dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   **Methane:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed
*   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
*   **Ethane:** 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension among the adsorbed molecules is 4.170 Å (for ethane).
There are no molecules reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion in the provided data for NH2-MIL-101(Fe). Therefore, an upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be determined from this data.

**Inferred Effective Pore Size Range:**
Based on the provided data, the effective pore size of NH2-MIL-101(Fe) is inferred to be **greater than or equal to 4.170 Å**. Since no "No" (size exclusion) data is available, there is no upper limit defined by the provided information.

**2. Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

Let's examine the target guest molecules and their intermediate dimensions:

*   **isoprene:** 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
*   **cis-2-pentene:** 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
*   **1-pentene:** 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
*   **trans-2-pentene:** 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
*   **n-pentane:** 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

**3. Comprehensive Judgment:**

For each target molecule, we compare its intermediate dimension with the inferred effective pore size of NH2-MIL-101(Fe) (>= 4.170 Å).
