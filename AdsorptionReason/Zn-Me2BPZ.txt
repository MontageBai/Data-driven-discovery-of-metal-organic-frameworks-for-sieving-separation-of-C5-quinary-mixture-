Based on the provided experimental data and molecular size information, here's the evaluation for Zn-Me2BPZ:

**1. Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size for Zn-Me2BPZ:**

From the experimental data, all listed guest molecules were adsorbed by Zn-Me2BPZ. We extract their full dimensions and calculate their intermediate dimensions:

*   **hexane**: 10.359×4.607×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.607 Å | Adsorbed
*   **2-methylpentane**: 9.023×6.376×4.923 Å → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Adsorbed
*   **3-methylpentane**: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed
*   **2,2-dimethylbutane**: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed
*   **2,3-dimethylbutane**: 7.778×6.170×5.399 Å → Intermediate = 6.170 Å | Adsorbed

The largest intermediate dimension among the adsorbed molecules is 6.545 Å (from 2,2-dimethylbutane). Since all provided data points indicate adsorption, and no size exclusion events are reported for this MOF, we can infer that the effective pore size of Zn-Me2BPZ is at least 6.545 Å.

**Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Me2BPZ: ≥ 6.545 Å**

**2. Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

MOF Name: Zn-Me2BPZ
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF's inferred effective pore size is at least 6.545 Å, as evidenced by the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) and other C6 isomers.
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the smallest known non-adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (no such data provided) and smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Zn-Me2BPZ. The experimental data shows "Size exclusion" as the mechanism, implying the pore size dictates the passage.

MOF Name: Zn-Me2BPZ
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF's inferred effective pore size is at least 6.545 Å, as evidenced by the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) and other C6 isomers.
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
*   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the smallest known non-adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (no such data provided) and smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Zn-Me2BPZ. The experimental data shows "Size exclusion" as the mechanism, implying the pore size dictates the passage.

MOF Name: Zn-Me2BPZ
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF's inferred effective pore size is at least 6.545 Å, as evidenced by the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) and other C6 isomers.
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
*   Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the smallest known non-adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (no such data provided) and smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Zn-Me2BPZ. The experimental data shows "Size exclusion" as the mechanism, implying the pore size dictates the passage.

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The MOF's inferred effective pore size is at least 6.545 Å, as evidenced by the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) and other C6 isomers.
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
*   Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the smallest known non-adsorbed molecule's intermediate dimension (no such data provided) and smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule (6.545 Å), it is geometrically compatible and can be adsorbed by Zn-Me2BPZ. The experimental data shows "Size exclusion" as the mechanism, implying the pore size dictates the passage.
