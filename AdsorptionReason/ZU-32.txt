MOF Name: ZU-32
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-32:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-32:
Based on the provided experimental data, ZU-32 is known to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. There is no experimental data provided for molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, we can only confidently infer that the effective pore size of ZU-32 is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. An upper bound for the pore size cannot be strictly determined from the available data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (3.200 Å). Given that the provided experimental data for ZU-32 only confirms adsorption of very small molecules and lacks information about larger molecules being adsorbed or explicitly excluded, the most reasonable inference, based on the principle of size exclusion, is that ZU-32's pores are not large enough to accommodate isoprene. Without further experimental data demonstrating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions between 3.200 Å and 6.093 Å, or explicit exclusion data for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, a definitive upper bound for the pore size cannot be established. However, for the purpose of this prediction based on the limited data, it is concluded that adsorption is unlikely due to size mismatch.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: ZU-32
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-32:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Based on the provided experimental data, ZU-32 is known to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. There is no experimental data provided for molecules that are *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, we can only confidently infer that the effective pore size of ZU-32 is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å. An upper bound for the pore size cannot be strictly determined from the available data.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (3.200 Å). Given that the provided experimental data for ZU-32 only confirms adsorption of very small molecules and lacks information about larger molecules being adsorbed or explicitly excluded, the most reasonable inference, based on the principle of size exclusion, is that ZU-32's pores are not large enough to accommodate cis-2-pentene. Without further experimental data demonstrating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions between 3.200 Å and 5.572 Å, or explicit exclusion data for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, a definitive upper bound for the pore size cannot be established. However, for the purpose of this prediction based on the limited data, it is concluded that adsorption is unlikely due to size mismatch.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

An upper bound for the pore size cannot be strictly determined from the available data.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (3.200 Å). Given that the provided experimental data for ZU-32 only confirms adsorption of very small molecules and lacks information about larger molecules being adsorbed or explicitly excluded, the most reasonable inference, based on the principle of size exclusion, is that ZU-32's pores are not large enough to accommodate 1-pentene. Without further experimental data demonstrating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions between 3.200 Å and 4.995 Å, or explicit exclusion data for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, a definitive upper bound for the pore size cannot be established. However, for the purpose of this prediction based on the limited data, it is concluded that adsorption is unlikely due to size mismatch.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (3.200 Å). Given that the provided experimental data for ZU-32 only confirms adsorption of very small molecules and lacks information about larger molecules being adsorbed or explicitly excluded, the most reasonable inference, based on the principle of size exclusion, is that ZU-32's pores are not large enough to accommodate trans-2-pentene. Without further experimental data demonstrating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions between 3.200 Å and 4.733 Å, or explicit exclusion data for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, a definitive upper bound for the pore size cannot be established.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the largest molecule explicitly shown to be adsorbed (3.200 Å). Given that the provided experimental data for ZU-32 only confirms adsorption of very small molecules and lacks information about larger molecules being adsorbed or explicitly excluded, the most reasonable inference, based on the principle of size exclusion, is that ZU-32's pores are not large enough to accommodate n-pentane. Without further experimental data demonstrating adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions between 3.200 Å and 4.364 Å, or explicit exclusion data for molecules larger than 3.200 Å, a definitive upper bound for the pore size cannot be established.
