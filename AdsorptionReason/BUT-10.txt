MOF Name: BUT-10
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-10:
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to "Exclusion based on pore environment"). This implies that propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å, cannot effectively pass through the pore opening.

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-10:
Based on the experimental data, BUT-10 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 4.354 Å (propane) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of BUT-10 is in the range of [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å).

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (5.051 Å) for BUT-10, it cannot be adsorbed.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-10:
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to "Exclusion based on pore environment"). This implies that propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å, cannot effectively pass through the pore opening.

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-10:
Based on the experimental data, BUT-10 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 4.354 Å (propane) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of BUT-10 is in the range of [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å).

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (5.051 Å) for BUT-10, it cannot be adsorbed.

MOF Name: BUT-10
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for BUT-10:
*   Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to "Exclusion based on pore environment"). This implies that propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å, cannot effectively pass through the pore opening.

Inferred effective pore size of BUT-10:
Based on the experimental data, BUT-10 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of at least 4.354 Å (propane) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å (propylene). Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of BUT-10 is in the range of [4.354 Å, 5.051 Å). The "Exclusion based on pore environment" for propylene suggests a very tight fit or kinetic sieving effect at 5.051 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is within the inferred effective pore size range ([4.354 Å, 5.051 Å)), and is slightly smaller than the excluded propylene (5.051 Å), it is geometrically possible for it to pass through and be adsorbed by BUT-10. Given its proximity to the exclusion limit, kinetic sieving phenomena might be expected, leading to slower diffusion.

Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is within the inferred effective pore size range ([4.354 Å, 5.051 Å)), and is smaller than the excluded propylene (5.051 Å), it is geometrically possible for it to pass through and be adsorbed by BUT-10.

n-pentane Dimensions:
*   n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is within the inferred effective pore size range ([4.354 Å, 5.051 Å)), and is very close to the size of adsorbed propane and significantly smaller than the excluded propylene (5.051 Å), it is geometrically possible for it to pass through and be adsorbed by BUT-10.
