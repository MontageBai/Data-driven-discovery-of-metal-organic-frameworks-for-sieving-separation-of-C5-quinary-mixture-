MOF Name: CUPMOF-5
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CUPMOF-5:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
- Oxygen (O2): 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
- Xenon (Xe): 4.320×4.320×4.320 → Intermediate = 4.320 Å | Not Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of CUPMOF-5:
Based on the provided rules, the effective pore size should be:
1.  Greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules. (CO2: 3.200 Å)
2.  Less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion). (O2: 2.860 Å, Xe: 4.320 Å. The smallest is O2: 2.860 Å)

This leads to a contradiction: the inferred pore size should be >= 3.200 Å AND < 2.860 Å, which is impossible. This suggests that the "Size exclusion" mechanism for oxygen, despite its smaller intermediate dimension compared to CO2, indicates a more complex size/shape selectivity or kinetic effect for oxygen, which is not fully captured by a simple intermediate dimension rule for all molecules.

To proceed with a predictive model based on the available data, and acknowledging the inconsistency, we prioritize the range defined by the largest adsorbed molecule (CO2) and the largest molecule clearly excluded by size (Xenon), as the oxygen exclusion appears to be an anomaly under the strict intermediate dimension interpretation. Therefore, we infer the effective pore size of CUPMOF-5 to be between 3.200 Å (from CO2 adsorption) and 4.320 Å (from Xenon non-adsorption).

Inferred effective pore size of CUPMOF-5 ≈ [3.200 Å, 4.320 Å).

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.320 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by CUPMOF-5.
