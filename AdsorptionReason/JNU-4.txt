MOF Name: JNU-4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From the experimental data for JNU-4:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The reason/mechanism explicitly states "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, Kinetic sieving". This indicates that the pore is effectively sized for acetylene, and its adsorption is already subject to size limitations and kinetic effects, implying a relatively tight fit.

Based on this single data point, the inferred effective pore size of JNU-4 is at least 3.200 Å, and given the mentioned "kinetic sieving" for acetylene, it is likely not significantly larger than this value, operating within the sub-nanometer regime.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of acetylene (3.200 Å), which is adsorbed with kinetic sieving and described as operating at the sub-nanometer scale, it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by JNU-4 due to size exclusion.

Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of acetylene (3.200 Å), which is adsorbed with kinetic sieving and described as operating at the sub-nanometer scale, it is highly probable that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by JNU-4 due to size exclusion.
