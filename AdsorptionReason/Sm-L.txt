Here is the analysis for Sm-L and the specified guest molecules:

MOF Name: Sm-L
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of Sm-L: The only experimental data provided for Sm-L confirms that carbon dioxide, with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, is adsorbed. This indicates that the effective pore size of Sm-L is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, which would typically define an upper limit for the pore size. Therefore, based on the provided limited information, we can only confirm the lower bound of the pore size.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by Sm-L (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). In the absence of experimental evidence or an inferred upper bound for the pore size that would accommodate molecules of this larger size, and considering that adsorption is driven by size exclusion principles, it is predicted that Sm-L cannot adsorb isoprene.

MOF Name: Sm-L
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of Sm-L: Only experimental data confirms that carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed. This indicates the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, preventing a determination of an upper limit for the pore size.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by Sm-L (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence or an inferred upper bound for the pore size that would accommodate molecules of this larger size, and based on the principle of size exclusion, it is predicted that Sm-L cannot adsorb cis-2-pentene.

MOF Name: Sm-L
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of Sm-L: Only experimental data confirms that carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed. This indicates the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, preventing a determination of an upper limit for the pore size.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by Sm-L (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence or an inferred upper bound for the pore size that would accommodate molecules of this larger size, and based on the principle of size exclusion, it is predicted that Sm-L cannot adsorb 1-pentene.

MOF Name: Sm-L
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of Sm-L: Only experimental data confirms that carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed. This indicates the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, preventing a determination of an upper limit for the pore size.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:

Conclusion:
trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by Sm-L (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence or an inferred upper bound for the pore size that would accommodate molecules of this larger size, and based on the principle of size exclusion, it is predicted that Sm-L cannot adsorb trans-2-pentene.

MOF Name: Sm-L
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of Sm-L: Only experimental data confirms that carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) is adsorbed. This indicates the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å.

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed by Sm-L (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å). Without any experimental evidence or an inferred upper bound for the pore size that would accommodate molecules of this larger size, and based on the principle of size exclusion, it is predicted that Sm-L cannot adsorb n-pentane.
