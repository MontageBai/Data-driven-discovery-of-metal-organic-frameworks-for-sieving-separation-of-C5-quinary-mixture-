MOF Name: Zn9(tba)9(dabco)3
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn9(tba)9(dabco)3:
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed
- 2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = 6.170 Å | Adsorbed
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of Zn9(tba)9(dabco)3: Since 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å) is adsorbed, the effective pore size must be at least 6.545 Å. There are no non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion) reported in the experimental data for this MOF, so we only have a lower bound.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the largest intermediate dimension of the experimentally adsorbed molecules (6.545 Å for 2,2-dimethylbutane), it is expected to be adsorbed by Zn9(tba)9(dabco)3. The experimental data suggests the MOF can accommodate molecules at least up to 6.545 Å.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
