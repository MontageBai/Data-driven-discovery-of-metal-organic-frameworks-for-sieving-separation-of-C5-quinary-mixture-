MOF Name: PAF-1-SO₃Ag

**Detailed Reasoning for PAF-1-SO₃Ag's Effective Pore Size:**
From the experimental data for PAF-1-SO₃Ag:
*   **Ethylene:** 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = 4.047 Å. It is Adsorbed, primarily due to "pi-complexation with Ag(I) sites". This indicates that molecules of this size *can* pass through the pores, and specific interactions enhance adsorption.
*   **Ethane:** 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate dimension = 4.175 Å. It is NOT Adsorbed, with the primary reason being "size exclusion for ethane". This is the critical data point for inferring the physical pore limiting dimension based on size.

Based on this, the effective pore size of PAF-1-SO₃Ag (for molecules without specific enhancing interactions like pi-complexation) is inferred to be **less than 4.175 Å**, as ethane (4.175 Å) is explicitly excluded by size. While ethylene (4.047 Å) passes, its adsorption is attributed to pi-complexation rather than just simple size compatibility. Therefore, any molecule with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 4.175 Å is expected to be excluded by size.

**Evaluation for Target Guest Molecules:**

**MOF Name: PAF-1-SO₃Ag**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate dimension = 6.093 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size limit of PAF-1-SO₃Ag (less than 4.175 Å, based on ethane's size exclusion), it cannot be adsorbed by the MOF.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate dimension = 5.572 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size limit of PAF-1-SO₃Ag (less than 4.175 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by the MOF.
