MOF Name: FJU-90
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Chemical adsorption via polar groups and pore partitioning)

Inferred effective pore size of FJU-90: The MOF is experimentally confirmed to adsorb carbon dioxide with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size is at least 3.200 Å. However, no experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, preventing the precise determination of an upper limit for the effective pore size based solely on size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than that of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å), the only molecule experimentally confirmed to be adsorbed. Given the "size exclusion effect" commonly observed in MOFs, where even small differences in molecular size can lead to complete exclusion (as demonstrated in the NTU-67 example where a ~0.8 Å difference led to non-adsorption), it is highly probable that a molecule almost twice the intermediate size of the largest known adsorbed molecule cannot be adsorbed. Without any experimental evidence of larger molecules being adsorbed, it is inferred that isoprene is too large to effectively enter and adsorb within FJU-90's pores.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
