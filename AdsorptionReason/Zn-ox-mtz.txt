MOF Name: Zn-ox-mtz
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-ox-mtz:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-ox-mtz lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, specifically it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or greater.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-ox-mtz due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn-ox-mtz
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-ox-mtz:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-ox-mtz lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, specifically it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or greater.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-ox-mtz due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn-ox-mtz
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-ox-mtz:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-ox-mtz lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, specifically it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or greater.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-ox-mtz due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn-ox-mtz
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-ox-mtz:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Zn-ox-mtz lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, specifically it allows molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å or greater.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Zn-ox-mtz due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Zn-ox-mtz
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zn-ox-mtz:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
