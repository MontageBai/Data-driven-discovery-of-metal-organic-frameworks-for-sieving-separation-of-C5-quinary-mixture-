MOF Name: UTSA-300

**Evaluation for isoprene:**

*   **Guest Molecule:** isoprene (7.746×6.093×3.963)
*   **Predicted Result:** Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-300:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to electrostatic repulsion, *not* size exclusion)
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to Size exclusion)

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-300 is:
*   Greater than or equal to the intermediate dimension of the adsorbed molecule (acetylene: 3.200 Å).
*   Less than the intermediate dimension of the non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion (ethylene: 4.047 Å).
Therefore, the effective pore size of UTSA-300 is inferred to be in the range **[3.200 Å, 4.047 Å)**.

Target Molecule Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of UTSA-300's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-300 due to size exclusion.

**Evaluation for cis-2-pentene:**

*   **Guest Molecule:** cis-2-pentene (8.067×5.572×5.136)
*   **Predicted Result:** Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-300:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to electrostatic repulsion, *not* size exclusion)
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to Size exclusion)

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-300 is in the range **[3.200 Å, 4.047 Å)**.

Target Molecule Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of UTSA-300's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-300 due to size exclusion.

**Evaluation for 1-pentene:**

*   **Guest Molecule:** 1-pentene (8.847×4.995×4.897)
*   **Predicted Result:** Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for UTSA-300:
*   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to electrostatic repulsion, *not* size exclusion)
*   Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (due to Size exclusion)

Based on this, the inferred effective pore size of UTSA-300 is in the range **[3.200 Å, 4.047 Å)**.

Target Molecule Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of UTSA-300's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-300 due to size exclusion.

Target Molecule Dimensions:
*   trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of UTSA-300's inferred effective pore size (4.047 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-300 due to size exclusion.
