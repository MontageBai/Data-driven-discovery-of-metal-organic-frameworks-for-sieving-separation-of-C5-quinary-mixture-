MOF Name: MOF 2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOF 2:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of MOF 2:
Based on the adsorbed molecules (acetylene and carbon dioxide with intermediate dimensions of 3.200 Å), the MOF's effective pore size must be at least 3.200 Å.
Based on the non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion (methane with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å), the MOF's effective pore size must be less than 3.877 Å.
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range for MOF 2 is **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**. This indicates that molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.877 Å will be excluded.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size for MOF 2 (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion. The experimental data also indicates a sieving mechanism at the sub-nanometer scale for this MOF.

Inferred effective pore size of MOF 2:
The inferred effective pore size range for MOF 2 is **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**. This indicates that molecules with an intermediate dimension greater than or equal to 3.877 Å will be excluded.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size for MOF 2 (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion. The experimental data also indicates a sieving mechanism at the sub-nanometer scale for this MOF.
