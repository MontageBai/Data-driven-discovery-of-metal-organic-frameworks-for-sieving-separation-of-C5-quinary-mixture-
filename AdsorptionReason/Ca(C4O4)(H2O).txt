MOF Name: Ca(C4O4)(H2O)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The reason given is "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale, Kinetic sieving." This suggests that the pore is precisely sized, allowing CO2 (3.200 Å intermediate dimension) to pass, but likely with a tight fit, as implied by "Kinetic sieving."

Inferred effective pore size of Ca(C4O4)(H2O) is inferred to be slightly larger than **3.200 Å**, given the kinetic sieving adsorption of CO2.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å) which is adsorbed via kinetic sieving (implying a tight fit), it is highly unlikely that isoprene can be adsorbed by Ca(C4O4)(H2O) due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of carbon dioxide (3.200 Å) which is adsorbed via kinetic sieving (implying a tight fit), it is highly unlikely that cis-2-pentene can be adsorbed by Ca(C4O4)(H2O) due to size exclusion.
