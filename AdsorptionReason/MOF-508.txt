**MOF Name: MOF-508**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data for MOF-508:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The adsorption mechanism is specified as "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale".

Inferred effective pore size of MOF-508: The adsorption of carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) explicitly stating "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" implies that the pore aperture of MOF-508 is approximately at or just above 3.200 Å. This suggests a very narrow pore environment where molecules significantly larger than this critical dimension would face steric hindrance.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of MOF-508 (approximately 3.200 Å), it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed due to size exclusion.
