MOF Name: Co(4-DPDS)2WO4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Co(4-DPDS)2WO4:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes, due to gate-opening effect)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion after activation)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to electrostatic repulsion, *not* size exclusion)

Based on the size exclusion data, the inferred effective pore size of Co(4-DPDS)2WO4 is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å (as acetylene is adsorbed, even if by gate-opening) and less than 4.047 Å (as ethylene is excluded by size). Thus, the effective pore size range is approximately **3.200 Å <= Pore Size < 4.047 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.047 Å) of Co(4-DPDS)2WO4, it cannot be adsorbed.
