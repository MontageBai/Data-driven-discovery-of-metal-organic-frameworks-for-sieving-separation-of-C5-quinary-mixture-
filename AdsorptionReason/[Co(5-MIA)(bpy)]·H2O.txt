MOF Name: [Co(5-MIA)(bpy)]·H2O

**Detailed Reasoning for MOF's Inferred Pore Characteristics:**

From the provided experimental adsorption data for [Co(5-MIA)(bpy)]·H2O:

*   **Adsorbed Molecules (Yes):**
    *   **carbon_dioxide**: 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.200 Å** (Adsorbed)
    *   **acetylene**: 5.538×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.200 Å** (Adsorbed, noted as Kinetic sieving)

*   **Non-Adsorbed Molecules (No):**
    *   **methane**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.877 Å** (Not Adsorbed, Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)
    *   **carbon_monoxide**: 4.168×3.200×3.200 Å → Intermediate dimension = **3.200 Å** (Not Adsorbed, Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

**Inferred Pore Size Analysis:**

Based on the instructions, we infer the MOF’s effective pore size range:
*   It must be greater than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of adsorbed molecules: ≥ **3.200 Å**.
*   It must be less than the smallest intermediate dimension of non-adsorbed molecules (due to size exclusion):
    *   Methane (3.877 Å) is excluded.
    *   Carbon Monoxide (3.200 Å) is also excluded.
    *   Therefore, the pore size must be < **3.200 Å** (due to CO exclusion).

This presents a direct contradiction: the pore must be ≥ 3.200 Å (to adsorb CO2/acetylene) and also < 3.200 Å (to exclude CO). This indicates that the "intermediate dimension" as a sole geometric criterion for "size exclusion" does not fully explain the observed behavior for this specific MOF and these linear molecules. The problem states "size exclusion" for CO, suggesting its effective dimension for passing through the MOF is greater than the pore, despite its "intermediate dimension" being 3.200 Å. This implies either shape-specific sieving, a more complex critical dimension, or a very tight fit where subtle differences dictate passage.

However, for practical prediction, we observe that the MOF successfully adsorbs molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (CO2, acetylene), but *definitively excludes* methane with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å due to size exclusion. This sets an effective upper limit for general adsorption based on this dimension around ~3.200 Å, with a clear cut-off below 3.877 Å for spherical-like molecules.

Given that all target molecules have intermediate dimensions significantly larger than 3.877 Å, it is highly probable they will be excluded.

MOF Name: [Co(5-MIA)(bpy)]·H2O
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the MOF adsorbs molecules with intermediate dimensions of 3.200 Å (carbon_dioxide, acetylene) but clearly excludes methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) and carbon_monoxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests a very narrow effective pore, capable of passing certain 3.200 Å molecules but not others, and definitely not molecules larger than 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate dimension = **6.093 Å**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any adsorbed molecule (3.200 Å) and also larger than molecules unequivocally excluded by size (methane at 3.877 Å), it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by [Co(5-MIA)(bpy)]·H2O.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, the MOF adsorbs molecules with intermediate dimensions of 3.200 Å (carbon_dioxide, acetylene) but clearly excludes methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) and carbon_monoxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the largest intermediate dimension of any adsorbed molecule (3.200 Å) and also larger than molecules unequivocally excluded by size (methane at 3.877 Å), it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by [Co(5-MIA)(bpy)]·H2O.
