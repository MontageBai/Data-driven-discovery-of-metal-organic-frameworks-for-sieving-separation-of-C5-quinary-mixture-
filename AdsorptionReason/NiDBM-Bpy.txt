MOF Name: NiDBM-Bpy

**Thinking Steps and Judgment Criteria Applied:**

1.  **Inferring the MOF’s Effective Pore Size:**
    From the experimental data for NiDBM-Bpy:
    *   **carbon_dioxide**: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = **3.200 Å** | Adsorbed (Yes), via "Gate-opening effect and guest-dependent structural dynamics".
    *   **nitrous_oxide**: 5.287×3.060×3.060 → Intermediate = **3.060 Å** | Adsorbed (Conditional), also via "Gate-opening effect and guest-dependent structural dynamics". This implies that even smaller molecules can trigger or pass through the open gate.
    *   **methane**: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = **3.877 Å** | Not Adsorbed (No), due to "Size exclusion due to inability to initiate structural transition". This indicates that methane is too large to pass through the pore, even if it could attempt to open it.

    Based on this, the NiDBM-Bpy material, even in its "open" or "transitioned" state, has an effective pore size that allows molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 3.200 Å (CO2) and 3.060 Å (N2O) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å (methane).

    Therefore, the inferred experimental effective pore size of NiDBM-Bpy is greater than or equal to **3.200 Å** and less than **3.877 Å**.
    Effective pore size ∈ [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å).

2.  **Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**
    *   **isoprene**: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**
    *   **cis-2-pentene**: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = **5.572 Å**
    *   **1-pentene**: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = **4.995 Å**
    *   **trans-2-pentene**: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = **4.733 Å**
    *   **n-pentane**: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = **4.364 Å**

**MOF Name: NiDBM-Bpy**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, NiDBM-Bpy adsorbs carbon dioxide (intermediate = 3.200 Å) and nitrous oxide (intermediate = 3.060 Å) but does not adsorb methane (intermediate = 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion and inability to initiate structural transition. This indicates that the effective pore size of NiDBM-Bpy, even in its activated/open state, is between approximately 3.200 Å and 3.877 Å.

Isoprene's dimensions are 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å, with an intermediate dimension of **6.093 Å**.

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of NiDBM-Bpy (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, NiDBM-Bpy adsorbs carbon dioxide (intermediate = 3.200 Å) and nitrous oxide (intermediate = 3.060 Å) but does not adsorb methane (intermediate = 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion and inability to initiate structural transition.

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of NiDBM-Bpy (~3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data, NiDBM-Bpy adsorbs carbon dioxide (intermediate = 3.200 Å) and nitrous oxide (intermediate = 3.060 Å) but does not adsorb methane (intermediate = 3.877 Å) due to size exclusion and inability to initiate structural transition.
