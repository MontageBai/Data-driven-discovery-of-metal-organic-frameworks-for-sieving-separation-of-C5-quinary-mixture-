MOF Name: HNUST-1
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for HNUST-1:
- Carbon dioxide (CO2): 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed. The stated primary mechanism for adsorption is "Chemical adsorption via open metal sites and ligand interaction". The "Sieving Mechanism" is "Not Reported".

The task specifically requires determining adsorption based on "size exclusion effect" and "kinetic sieving effect." The provided experimental data for HNUST-1 explicitly attributes carbon dioxide adsorption to a "Chemical adsorption" mechanism, not to "size exclusion" or "kinetic sieving." Therefore, this data point cannot be used to infer the MOF's general effective pore size or its behavior concerning size exclusion for other molecules.

Furthermore, no experimental data points are provided where any molecule was *not* adsorbed by HNUST-1 due to size exclusion. Consequently, neither an upper limit for the MOF's effective pore size related to size exclusion can be established, nor can a general size exclusion threshold be inferred from the given information.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since the only provided adsorption data for HNUST-1 refers to a specific chemical adsorption mechanism for carbon dioxide (intermediate 3.200 Å) and offers no information about its pore size limitations based on size exclusion or kinetic sieving, it is not possible to confirm that isoprene (intermediate 6.093 Å) can be adsorbed via these size-dependent mechanisms. In the absence of evidence for size-dependent passage for molecules larger than CO2, and with the only known adsorption mechanism being chemical and specific to CO2, it cannot be concluded that isoprene will be adsorbed by HNUST-1 through size exclusion or kinetic sieving.
