**MOF Name: RPM1-Co**

**Known Experimental Data Analysis:**

*   **Carbon Tetrafluoride (CF4):**
    *   Full Dimensions: 4.906×4.704×4.636 Å
    *   Intermediate Dimension: **4.704 Å**
    *   Experimental Result: "Conditional" (Kinetic sieving) and "No" (Kinetic separation).
    *   Interpretation: The fact that CF4 (intermediate dimension 4.704 Å) is either "Conditional" or "No" in adsorption, with "Kinetic sieving/separation" cited as the mechanism, indicates that this molecule is at or beyond the practical adsorption limit for RPM1-Co under certain conditions. Kinetic sieving implies that while the molecule might *physically* be able to enter, its diffusion is severely restricted due to a very tight fit, leading to negligible or very slow adsorption rates. Therefore, for practical purposes, RPM1-Co's effective pore size for adsorption is likely **less than 4.704 Å**. Molecules with intermediate dimensions equal to or greater than 4.704 Å are unlikely to be adsorbed in significant quantities under standard conditions.

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of RPM1-Co for Practical Adsorption:** < 4.704 Å

**Evaluation of Target Guest Molecules:**

**1. Guest Molecule: isoprene**

*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

*   Detailed Reasoning:
    *   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å
    *   Isoprene Intermediate Dimension: **6.093 Å**
    *   Comparison: Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size threshold of RPM1-Co (< 4.704 Å).
    *   Conclusion: Based on size exclusion, isoprene cannot be adsorbed by RPM1-Co.

**2. Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

*   Detailed Reasoning:
    *   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å
    *   cis-2-pentene Intermediate Dimension: **5.572 Å**
    *   Comparison: cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size threshold of RPM1-Co (< 4.704 Å).
    *   Conclusion: Based on size exclusion, cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by RPM1-Co.

**3. Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

*   Detailed Reasoning:
    *   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å
    *   1-pentene Intermediate Dimension: **4.995 Å**
    *   Comparison: 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the inferred effective pore size threshold of RPM1-Co (< 4.704 Å).
    *   Conclusion: Based on size exclusion, 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by RPM1-Co.

**4. Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene**

*   Predicted Result: **Cannot Adsorb**

*   Detailed Reasoning:
    *   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å
    *   trans-2-pentene Intermediate Dimension: **4.733 Å**
    *   Comparison: trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is larger than the inferred effective pore size threshold of RPM1-Co (< 4.704 Å). This molecule is very close to the reported "No" adsorption limit of Carbon Tetrafluoride, indicating it would also be kinetically hindered or excluded.
    *   Conclusion: Based on size exclusion and kinetic limitations, trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by RPM1-Co.

**5. Guest Molecule: n-pentane**

*   Predicted Result: **Can Adsorb**

*   Detailed Reasoning:
    *   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å
    *   n-pentane Intermediate Dimension: **4.364 Å**
    *   Comparison: n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the inferred effective pore size threshold of RPM1-Co (< 4.704 Å). While Carbon Tetrafluoride (4.704 Å) showed "No" or "Conditional" adsorption due to kinetic sieving, implying a very tight pore for molecules of that size, n-pentane is smaller and thus *geometrically capable* of passing through the pores. The phrase "can adsorb" focuses on the possibility of physical entry.
    *   Conclusion: Based on its intermediate dimension being smaller than the determined practical non-adsorption threshold, n-pentane can theoretically be adsorbed by RPM1-Co, although potential kinetic limitations due to the tight pore cannot be entirely ruled out for practical applications.
