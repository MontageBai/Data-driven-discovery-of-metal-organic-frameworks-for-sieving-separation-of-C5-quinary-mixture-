MOF Name: Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
Based on the provided data, the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is 5.051 Å (propylene). There are no reported molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. Therefore, the MOF's pores are inferred to be at least 5.051 Å. For a molecule to be predicted as "Can Adsorb" based *solely* on the provided data and the rules, its intermediate dimension must be less than or equal to the largest confirmed adsorbed molecule, or within a fully defined pore range.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the largest molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) confirmed to be adsorbed by Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]. Without experimental data explicitly confirming the adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions greater than 5.051 Å, or a defined upper limit from size-excluded molecules, we cannot confidently predict that isoprene can be adsorbed based on the given information. Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**.

MOF Name: Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is 5.051 Å (propylene). The MOF's pores are inferred to be at least 5.051 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the largest molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) confirmed to be adsorbed by Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]. Lacking further evidence for larger pore accessibility, adsorption cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**.

MOF Name: Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is 5.051 Å (propylene). This implies the MOF's pores are at least 5.051 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than or equal to the largest molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) confirmed to be adsorbed by Ni[Fe(CN)5NO], it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**.

MOF Name: Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

Inferred effective pore size of Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is 5.051 Å (propylene). This implies the MOF's pores are at least 5.051 Å.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than or equal to the largest molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) confirmed to be adsorbed by Ni[Fe(CN)5NO), it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**.

Inferred effective pore size of Ni[Fe(CN)5NO]:
The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule confirmed to be adsorbed is 5.051 Å (propylene). This implies the MOF's pores are at least 5.051 Å.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than or equal to the largest molecule (propylene, 5.051 Å) confirmed to be adsorbed by Ni[Fe(CN)5NO], it is expected to be able to pass through the pores. Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**.
