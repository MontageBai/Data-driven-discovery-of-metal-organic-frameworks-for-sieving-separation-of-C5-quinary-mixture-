MOF Name: ZIF-62
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZIF-62:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Conditional (due to breathing effect/size exclusion)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed
- 2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 → Intermediate = 6.376 Å | Conditional (due to breathing effect/size exclusion)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Based on this, ZIF-62 consistently adsorbs molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (propylene). Molecules such as propane (4.354 Å) and 2-methylpentane (6.376 Å) are conditionally adsorbed, which is attributed to the "breathing effect and structural expansion upon gas adsorption" of ZIF-62, indicating the MOF can adapt its pore size. The smallest molecule definitively excluded by size exclusion is 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å).
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size allows for adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions up to approximately 6.376 Å (conditionally at this size), while strictly excluding molecules from 6.545 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than that of 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å), which is definitively excluded. It is also smaller than or comparable to 2-methylpentane (6.376 Å), which is conditionally adsorbed. Given ZIF-62's "breathing effect" mechanism, it is capable of accommodating molecules of this size.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**

Therefore, the inferred effective pore size allows for adsorption of molecules with intermediate dimensions up to approximately 6.376 Å (conditionally at this size), while strictly excluding molecules from 6.545 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than propylene (5.051 Å, adsorbed) but smaller than 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å, not adsorbed). It falls within the range where ZIF-62 exhibits "breathing effect" and "structural expansion", as evidenced by the conditional adsorption of 2-methylpentane (6.376 Å). Therefore, ZIF-62 is expected to accommodate cis-2-pentene.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is very close to that of propane (4.354 Å), which is listed as conditionally adsorbed. Although propane is conditional, it implies that adsorption *can* occur. Given that ZIF-62 exhibits a "breathing effect and structural expansion upon gas adsorption", it is reasonable to expect n-pentane, a saturated hydrocarbon similar in size to propane, to also be adsorbed by the MOF, likely with a conditional behavior similar to propane. For a binary "Can Adsorb / Cannot Adsorb" prediction, "Can Adsorb" is appropriate given the 'conditional' nature means it is not strictly excluded.

Therefore, the result is: **Can Adsorb**
