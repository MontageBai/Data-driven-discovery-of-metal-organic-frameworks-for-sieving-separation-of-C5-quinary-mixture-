MOF Name: MAMS-3
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAMS-3:
- Oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed (at 87 K)
- Carbon monoxide: 4.168×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (at 113 K)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (at 143 K)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed (at 195 K)
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed (at 231 K)
- Isobutane: 6.404×6.393×4.866 → Intermediate = 6.393 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to channel size limit, at 231 K)

The adsorption mechanism for MAMS-3 is described as "Temperature-dependent molecular sieving via tert-butyl gating", meaning the effective pore size increases with temperature.
At 231 K:
- Molecules with an intermediate dimension up to 5.051 Å (Propylene) can be adsorbed.
- Molecules with an intermediate dimension of 6.393 Å (Isobutane) cannot be adsorbed due to "channel size limit". This suggests 6.393 Å is an effective upper bound for the pore opening even with temperature-induced gating.

Given that the target adsorption is at standard conditions (298 K), which is a higher temperature than the experimental condition where isobutane was excluded (231 K), the gate should be at least as open, or even more open, than at 231 K. Therefore, any molecule with an intermediate dimension less than 6.393 Å should be able to pass.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K, and considering the temperature-dependent gate opening mechanism, isoprene should be able to pass through the larger pores at 298 K.

MOF Name: MAMS-3
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAMS-3 (as detailed above), the effective pore size at 298 K (higher than 231 K) is inferred to be less than 6.393 Å (intermediate dimension of isobutane, which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K). Molecules with intermediate dimensions up to 5.051 Å (Propylene) are adsorbed at 231 K.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K, and considering the temperature-dependent gate opening mechanism, cis-2-pentene should be able to pass through the larger pores at 298 K.

Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MAMS-3 (as detailed above), the effective pore size at 298 K (higher than 231 K) is inferred to be less than 6.393 Å (intermediate dimension of isobutane, which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K).

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K, and considering the temperature-dependent gate opening mechanism, 1-pentene should be able to pass through the larger pores at 298 K. Furthermore, it is comparable in size to propylene (5.051 Å) which was adsorbed at 231 K.

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K, and considering the temperature-dependent gate opening mechanism, trans-2-pentene should be able to pass through the larger pores at 298 K.

Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of isobutane (6.393 Å), which was excluded due to channel size limit at 231 K, and considering the temperature-dependent gate opening mechanism, n-pentane should be able to pass through the larger pores at 298 K.
