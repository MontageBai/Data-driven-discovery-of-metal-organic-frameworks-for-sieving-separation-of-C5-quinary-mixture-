MOF Name: NU-1000
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NU-1000:
- Propyne: 6.433×3.818×3.961 → Intermediate = 3.961 Å | Adsorbed
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Conditional (Reason: Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Inferred effective pore size of NU-1000:
The MOF is able to adsorb propyne (intermediate dimension 3.961 Å), which suggests its effective pore size is at least 3.961 Å. However, carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å), a smaller molecule, experiences "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale" leading to "Conditional" adsorption. This indicates that NU-1000's pores are highly size-selective and potentially exhibit kinetic sieving effects, where molecules, even if smaller, face significant restrictions or only specific orientations/pathways allow passage. The largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed without conditional size exclusion is propyne (3.961 Å). This implies a tight pore environment.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the largest molecule confirmed to be adsorbed (propyne, 3.961 Å), and given the evidence of highly selective and tight pores (indicated by the conditional adsorption of CO2 due to size exclusion), it is highly probable that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by NU-1000 due to size exclusion.
