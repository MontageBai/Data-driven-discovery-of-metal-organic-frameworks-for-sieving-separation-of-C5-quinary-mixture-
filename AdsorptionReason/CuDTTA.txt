MOF Name: CuDTTA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for CuDTTA:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (No, due to Size exclusion)
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Conditional (due to Size exclusion)
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Conditional (due to Size exclusion)

Based on the clear "No" for methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) due to "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale," the effective pore size of CuDTTA must be strictly less than 3.877 Å. The adsorption of acetylene and carbon dioxide (both intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) confirms the pore size is at least 3.200 Å.
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of CuDTTA lies in the range of [3.200 Å, 3.877 Å). While ethylene (4.047 Å) and ethane (4.170 Å) are listed as "Conditional" with "Size exclusion" as the mechanism, their intermediate dimensions are larger than that of methane, which is explicitly not adsorbed. This reinforces that the pore effectively excludes molecules with intermediate dimensions at or above 3.877 Å under the given conditions.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred upper limit of CuDTTA's effective pore size (< 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by CuDTTA due to size exclusion.
