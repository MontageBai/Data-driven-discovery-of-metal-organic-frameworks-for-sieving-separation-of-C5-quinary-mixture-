MOF Name: ZnAtzPO4
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZnAtzPO4:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZnAtzPO4:
The MOF adsorbs ethylene (intermediate 4.047 Å) but excludes ethane (intermediate 4.175 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of ZnAtzPO4 is greater than or equal to 4.047 Å and less than 4.175 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.175 Å) for ZnAtzPO4, it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF via size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZnAtzPO4
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZnAtzPO4:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZnAtzPO4:
The MOF adsorbs ethylene (intermediate 4.047 Å) but excludes ethane (intermediate 4.175 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of ZnAtzPO4 is greater than or equal to 4.047 Å and less than 4.175 Å.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.175 Å) for ZnAtzPO4, it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF via size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZnAtzPO4
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZnAtzPO4:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.175 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZnAtzPO4:

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.175 Å) for ZnAtzPO4, it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF via size exclusion.

Target Guest Molecule Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (4.175 Å) for ZnAtzPO4, it cannot be adsorbed by this MOF via size exclusion.
