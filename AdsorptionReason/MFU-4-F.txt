To determine whether MFU-4-F can adsorb the specified guest molecules, we first infer the MOF’s effective pore size based on the provided experimental data.

**1. Inferring MFU-4-F’s Effective Pore Size:**
From the experimental data for MFU-4-F:
*   **carbon dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)
*   **acetylene:** 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed (Yes)

The largest intermediate dimension of an adsorbed molecule is 3.200 Å. This indicates that the effective pore size of MFU-4-F is at least 3.200 Å.

Crucially, the provided experimental data for MFU-4-F *does not include any guest molecules that were "Not Adsorbed" specifically due to "Size exclusion"*. The reasons given for adsorption/selectivity for MFU-4-F are related to "Equilibrium separation," which implies molecules *can* enter the pores.

Therefore, an upper limit for the effective pore size based on size exclusion cannot be inferred from the given experimental data for MFU-4-F. Without a data point indicating a molecule was excluded due to its size, we cannot definitively conclude "Cannot Adsorb" for larger molecules based solely on size exclusion from this dataset.

**2. Evaluate Target Guest Molecules:**

We will now evaluate each target molecule, extracting its intermediate dimension.

MOF Name: MFU-4-F
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MFU-4-F:
-   Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
-   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MFU-4-F: The MOF is confirmed to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. The provided data does not include any guest molecules that were "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion." Therefore, an upper limit for the effective pore size based on size exclusion cannot be inferred from the given experimental data.

Isoprene Dimensions:
-   isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
While isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the confirmed adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å), the experimental data for MFU-4-F does not provide any information about molecules being excluded due to size. Without a specific "Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion)" data point for MFU-4-F, it cannot be concluded that isoprene will be size-excluded. Given that the stated adsorption mechanism for the observed molecules is "Equilibrium separation" (implying the molecules can enter the pores), and no size exclusion barrier is presented in the data, it is predicted that MFU-4-F *can* adsorb isoprene.

Inferred effective pore size of MFU-4-F: The MOF is confirmed to adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å. The provided data does not include any guest molecules that were "Not Adsorbed" due to "Size exclusion."

Conclusion:
While cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the confirmed adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å), the experimental data for MFU-4-F does not provide any information about molecules being excluded due to size. Without a specific "Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion)" data point for MFU-4-F, it cannot be concluded that cis-2-pentene will be size-excluded. Given that the stated adsorption mechanism for the observed molecules is "Equilibrium separation" (implying the molecules can enter the pores), and no size exclusion barrier is presented in the data, it is predicted that MFU-4-F *can* adsorb cis-2-pentene.

While 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of the confirmed adsorbed molecules (3.200 Å), the experimental data for MFU-4-F does not provide any information about molecules being excluded due to size. Without a specific "Not Adsorbed (due to size exclusion)" data point for MFU-4-F, it cannot be concluded that 1-pentene will be size-excluded. Given that the stated adsorption mechanism for the observed molecules is "Equilibrium separation" (implying the molecules can enter the pores), and no size exclusion barrier is presented in the data, it is predicted that MFU-4-F *can* adsorb 1-pentene.
