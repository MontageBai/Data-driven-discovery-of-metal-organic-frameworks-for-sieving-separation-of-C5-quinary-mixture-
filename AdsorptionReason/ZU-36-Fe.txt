Here's the detailed evaluation of ZU-36-Fe's adsorption capacity for the specified guest molecules:

MOF Name: ZU-36-Fe
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Fe:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Fe lies between **5.151 Å (inclusive) and 5.310 Å (exclusive)**. This means the MOF can accommodate molecules with intermediate dimensions up to approximately 5.151 Å, but not 5.310 Å or larger.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the inferred upper limit of ZU-36-Fe's effective pore size (~5.151 Å, as 5.310 Å is excluded), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-36-Fe due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Fe
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Fe:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Fe lies between **5.151 Å (inclusive) and 5.310 Å (exclusive)**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is larger than the inferred upper limit of ZU-36-Fe's effective pore size (~5.151 Å, as 5.310 Å is excluded), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-36-Fe due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Fe
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Fe:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Fe lies between **5.151 Å (inclusive) and 5.310 Å (exclusive)**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of trans-2-butene (5.151 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by ZU-36-Fe, it is predicted that 1-pentene can also be adsorbed due to geometric compatibility.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Fe
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Fe:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Fe lies between **5.151 Å (inclusive) and 5.310 Å (exclusive)**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of trans-2-butene (5.151 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by ZU-36-Fe, it is predicted that trans-2-pentene can also be adsorbed due to geometric compatibility.

MOF Name: ZU-36-Fe
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for ZU-36-Fe:
- trans-2-butene: 7.219×5.151×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.151 Å | Adsorbed
- cis-2-butene: 6.702×5.310×3.960 → Intermediate = 5.310 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion due to contracted pore window)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-36-Fe lies between **5.151 Å (inclusive) and 5.310 Å (exclusive)**.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of trans-2-butene (5.151 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by ZU-36-Fe, it is predicted that n-pentane can also be adsorbed due to geometric compatibility.
