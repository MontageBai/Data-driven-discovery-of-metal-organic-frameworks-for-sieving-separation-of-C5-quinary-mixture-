MOF Name: MOF-177

Experimental Data Analysis:
*   **Adsorbed (Yes):**
    *   **carbon_dioxide:** 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å.
*   **Not Adsorbed (No):**
    *   **methane:** 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å.

Inferred Effective Pore Size of MOF-177:
Based on the provided experimental data, MOF-177 is capable of adsorbing carbon dioxide (intermediate dimension: 3.200 Å) but does not adsorb methane (intermediate dimension: 3.877 Å). Although the specific mechanism for non-adsorption of methane is "Not Reported", for the purpose of determining adsorption capability based on size exclusion, we infer that the effective pore size of MOF-177 is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å. Thus, the inferred effective pore size of MOF-177 lies in the range **[3.200 Å, 3.877 Å)**.

MOF Name: MOF-177
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for MOF-177:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of MOF-177 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) significantly exceeds the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size of MOF-177 (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by MOF-177.
