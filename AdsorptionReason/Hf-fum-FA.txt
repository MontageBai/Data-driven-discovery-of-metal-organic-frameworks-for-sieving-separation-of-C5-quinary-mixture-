MOF Name: Hf-fum-FA
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-fum-FA, molecules that were *not adsorbed* due to "Size exclusion":
- 2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 → Intermediate = 6.376 Å
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å
- 2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = 6.170 Å
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å

Since all these molecules were explicitly stated as *not adsorbed* due to "Size exclusion", the effective pore size of Hf-fum-FA must be smaller than the smallest intermediate dimension among them. The smallest intermediate dimension is 6.008 Å (from 3-methylpentane).
Thus, the inferred effective pore size of Hf-fum-FA is **< 6.008 Å**. No molecules were reported as adsorbed, so no lower bound for pore size can be inferred.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is larger than the inferred effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Hf-fum-FA due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Hf-fum-FA
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Hf-fum-FA, molecules that were *not adsorbed* due to "Size exclusion":
- 2-methylpentane: 9.023×6.376×4.923 → Intermediate = 6.376 Å
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 → Intermediate = 6.008 Å
- 2,3-dimethylbutane: 7.778×6.170×5.399 → Intermediate = 6.170 Å
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 → Intermediate = 6.545 Å

The smallest intermediate dimension among these non-adsorbed molecules is 6.008 Å (from 3-methylpentane).
Thus, the inferred effective pore size of Hf-fum-FA is **< 6.008 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is geometrically expected to be adsorbed by Hf-fum-FA. The experimental conditions (303 K to 423 K, 10 kPa) are different from standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar), but the size exclusion mechanism is primarily geometric.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is geometrically expected to be adsorbed by Hf-fum-FA. The experimental conditions (303 K to 423 K, 10 kPa) are different from standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar), but the size exclusion mechanism is primarily geometric.

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is smaller than the inferred upper limit of the effective pore size (< 6.008 Å), it is geometrically expected to be adsorbed by Hf-fum-FA. The experimental conditions (303 K to 423 K, 10 kPa) are different from standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar), but the size exclusion mechanism is primarily geometric.
