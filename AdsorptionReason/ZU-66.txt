Here's the analysis for ZU-66 and the target guest molecules based on the provided data:

**1. Inferring ZU-66's Effective Pore Size:**

From the experimental data:
*   **Carbon dioxide (CO2):** 5.198×3.200×3.200 Å. Sorted dimensions: 3.200, 3.200, 5.198 Å. **Intermediate dimension = 3.200 Å.** Adsorbed (Yes).
*   **Methane (CH4):** 3.877×3.849×3.918 Å. Sorted dimensions: 3.849, 3.877, 3.918 Å. **Intermediate dimension = 3.877 Å.** Not Adsorbed (No, due to size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale).

Based on this, ZU-66 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å, but it excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.877 Å. This indicates a very narrow pore aperture, likely operating via a kinetic sieving mechanism.

Therefore, the inferred effective pore size of ZU-66 is approximately **greater than or equal to 3.200 Å and less than 3.877 Å**.

**2. Evaluating Target Guest Molecules:**

We will compare the intermediate dimension of each target molecule to the inferred effective pore size range of ZU-66.

**MOF Name: ZU-66**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-66 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, allowing molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å and excluding those ≥ 3.877 Å.

Isoprene Dimensions:
*   Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å. Sorted dimensions: 3.963, 6.093, 7.746 Å. **Intermediate = 6.093 Å.**

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-66 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZU-66**
**Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-66 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, allowing molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å and excluding those ≥ 3.877 Å.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
*   cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å. Sorted dimensions: 5.136, 5.572, 8.067 Å. **Intermediate = 5.572 Å.**

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-66 due to size exclusion.

**MOF Name: ZU-66**
**Guest Molecule: 1-pentene**

**Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-66 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, allowing molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å and excluding those ≥ 3.877 Å.

1-pentene Dimensions:
*   1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å. Sorted dimensions: 4.897, 4.995, 8.847 Å. **Intermediate = 4.995 Å.**

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-66 due to size exclusion.

From experimental data:
*   Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of ZU-66 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, allowing molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å and excluding those ≥ 3.877 Å.

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-66 due to size exclusion.

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (less than 3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by ZU-66 due to size exclusion.
