**MOF Name: Zr-abtc**

**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Zr-abtc:
- 3-methylpentane: 9.052×6.008×4.985 Å → Intermediate = 6.008 Å | Adsorbed (Thermodynamic separation, implying pore passage)
- 2,2-dimethylbutane: 7.829×5.502×6.545 Å → Intermediate = 6.545 Å | Adsorbed (Thermodynamic separation, implying pore passage)

Based on the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane (intermediate dimension 6.545 Å), the inferred effective pore size of Zr-abtc is at least 6.545 Å. There is no experimental data indicating size exclusion for any molecule, suggesting the pores are sufficiently large for molecules of these sizes to pass.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is less than the intermediate dimension of 2,2-dimethylbutane (6.545 Å), which is known to be adsorbed by Zr-abtc, it is predicted that isoprene can also be adsorbed. The experimental data explicitly states "Thermodynamic separation based on adsorption strength" for the known adsorbed molecules, indicating that size is not a limiting factor for these sizes.
