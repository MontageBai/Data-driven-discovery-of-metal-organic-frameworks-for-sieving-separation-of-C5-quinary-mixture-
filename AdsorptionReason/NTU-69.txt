MOF Name: NTU-69
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-69:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-69:
Based on the experimental data, NTU-69 can adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 3.200 Å (acetylene) but cannot adsorb molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size of NTU-69 is greater than 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å.

Target Guest Molecule (isoprene) Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which was already excluded by NTU-69 due to size exclusion, isoprene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: NTU-69
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-69:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-69:
The effective pore size of NTU-69 is inferred to be greater than 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å.

Target Guest Molecule (cis-2-pentene) Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which was excluded by NTU-69, cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: NTU-69
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-69:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-69:
The effective pore size of NTU-69 is inferred to be greater than 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å.

Target Guest Molecule (1-pentene) Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which was excluded by NTU-69, 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: NTU-69
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-69:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-69:
The effective pore size of NTU-69 is inferred to be greater than 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å.

Target Guest Molecule (trans-2-pentene) Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which was excluded by NTU-69, trans-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**

MOF Name: NTU-69
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for NTU-69:
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of NTU-69:
The effective pore size of NTU-69 is inferred to be greater than 3.200 Å but less than 4.047 Å.

Target Guest Molecule (n-pentane) Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than the intermediate dimension of ethylene (4.047 Å), which was excluded by NTU-69 due to size exclusion, n-pentane cannot be adsorbed.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
