**MOF Name: Zn-Ade-TCPE**

**Experimental Data Summary for Zn-Ade-TCPE:**
*   **Adsorbed:**
    *   Benzene: 7.134×6.762×3.200 Å → Intermediate = **6.762 Å**
*   **Not Adsorbed (Size Exclusion):**
    *   Cyclohexane: 6.949×7.090×4.855 Å → Intermediate = **6.949 Å**

**Inferred Effective Pore Size of Zn-Ade-TCPE:**
Based on the experimental data, Zn-Ade-TCPE can adsorb benzene (intermediate dimension 6.762 Å) but cannot adsorb cyclohexane (intermediate dimension 6.949 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore aperture of Zn-Ade-TCPE is approximately in the range of **[6.762 Å, 6.949 Å)**.

**MOF Name: Zn-Ade-TCPE**
**Guest Molecule: isoprene**

**Predicted Result: Can Adsorb**

**Detailed Reasoning:**
*   The MOF’s known adsorbed molecule is benzene (intermediate dimension: 6.762 Å).
*   The MOF’s known non-adsorbed molecule due to size exclusion is cyclohexane (intermediate dimension: 6.949 Å).
*   Inferred effective pore size of Zn-Ade-TCPE is approximately **[6.762 Å, 6.949 Å)**.
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = **6.093 Å**.
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is smaller than the intermediate dimension of benzene (6.762 Å), which is known to be adsorbed, and also smaller than the pore exclusion limit inferred from cyclohexane (6.949 Å), it is predicted to be adsorbed by Zn-Ade-TCPE. No kinetic sieving information is available for similar molecules to suggest a strong impediment at this size.
