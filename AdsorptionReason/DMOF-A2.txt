MOF Name: DMOF-A2
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed (Reason: Hydrophobicity and pore size optimization enhance CH4/N2 separation. Adsorption Type: Size exclusion)

From other known guest molecule probe sizes:
- Nitrogen: 4.165×3.060×3.060 → Intermediate = 3.060 Å

Inferred effective pore size of DMOF-A2:
The MOF adsorbs methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å). The experimental data states that DMOF-A2 enhances CH4/N2 separation via "Size exclusion". Given that nitrogen (intermediate dimension 3.060 Å) is *smaller* than methane (3.877 Å), the separation by "size exclusion" is not a simple geometric exclusion of a larger molecule. This strongly suggests a kinetic sieving mechanism, where the pore opening is highly selective and precisely tuned to allow methane while kinetically hindering or excluding the smaller nitrogen, possibly due to specific interactions or a subtle shape difference. This implies that the effective pore aperture is very close to methane's intermediate dimension (~3.877 Å), making it highly restrictive for molecules even slightly larger.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the inferred effective pore size of DMOF-A2 (~3.877 Å), and considering the MOF's reported precise "size exclusion" and kinetic sieving behavior for small gas molecules (CH4 vs. N2), it is highly unlikely that DMOF-A2 can adsorb isoprene.

Therefore, the result is: **Cannot Adsorb**
