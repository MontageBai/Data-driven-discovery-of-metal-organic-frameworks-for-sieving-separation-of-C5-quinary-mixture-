MOF Name: UTSA-280 MOF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-280 MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.170 Å (ethane). Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be in the range of **4.047 Å to less than 4.170 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 Å → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.170 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-280 MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: UTSA-280 MOF
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-280 MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.170 Å (ethane). Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be in the range of **4.047 Å to less than 4.170 Å**.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 Å → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.170 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-280 MOF due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: UTSA-280 MOF
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-280 MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.170 Å (ethane). Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be in the range of **4.047 Å to less than 4.170 Å**.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 Å → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.170 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-280 MOF due to size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-280 MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.170 Å (ethane). Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be in the range of **4.047 Å to less than 4.170 Å**.

trans-2-pentene Dimensions:
- trans-2-pentene: 8.796×4.733×4.564 Å → Intermediate = 4.733 Å

Conclusion:
Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.170 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-280 MOF due to size exclusion.

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 Å → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 Å → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of UTSA-280 MOF allows molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.047 Å (ethylene) but excludes molecules with an intermediate dimension of 4.170 Å (ethane). Therefore, the effective pore size is inferred to be in the range of **4.047 Å to less than 4.170 Å**.

n-pentane Dimensions:
- n-pentane: 9.118×4.364×3.969 Å → Intermediate = 4.364 Å

Conclusion:
Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (< 4.170 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by UTSA-280 MOF due to size exclusion.
