MOF Name: Be-ZIF-7-8
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Be-ZIF-7-8:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Be-ZIF-7-8 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with intermediate dimension ≥ 3.877 Å. This indicates a very precise size exclusion threshold.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Be-ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.

MOF Name: Be-ZIF-7-8
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for Be-ZIF-7-8:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of Be-ZIF-7-8 lies between **3.200 Å and 3.877 Å**, meaning it allows molecules with intermediate dimension ≤ 3.200 Å but excludes molecules with intermediate dimension ≥ 3.877 Å. This indicates a very precise size exclusion threshold.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Be-ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by Be-ZIF-7-8 due to size exclusion.
