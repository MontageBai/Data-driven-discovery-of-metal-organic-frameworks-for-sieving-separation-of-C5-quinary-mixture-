MOF Name: JLU-Liu18

Detailed Reasoning for JLU-Liu18's Effective Pore Size:
From the provided experimental adsorption data for JLU-Liu18:
*   carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
*   methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Adsorbed
*   ethane: 4.731×4.175×4.170 → Intermediate = 4.170 Å | Adsorbed
*   propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed (This is the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed)
*   oxygen: 4.076×2.860×2.860 → Intermediate = 2.860 Å | Adsorbed

There are no molecules reported as "Not Adsorbed" due to size exclusion. Therefore, based *solely* on the provided data, we can only infer a lower bound for JLU-Liu18's effective pore size. The MOF is confirmed to adsorb molecules with intermediate dimensions up to at least 4.354 Å (from propane). An upper limit for the pore size cannot be determined from the available data.

For the purpose of predicting adsorption based strictly on the provided data, a molecule is predicted to "Can Adsorb" if its intermediate dimension is less than or equal to the largest intermediate dimension of a molecule explicitly confirmed to be adsorbed (4.354 Å). If a molecule's intermediate dimension is greater than this value, its adsorption cannot be confirmed or denied based solely on the *available* size exclusion data; however, to provide a definitive "Can Adsorb / Cannot Adsorb" answer as requested, and in the absence of an observed upper limit for size exclusion, a conservative approach is taken: if the molecule's intermediate dimension is larger than the maximum known adsorbed molecule, adsorption cannot be definitively proven with the given data.

MOF Name: JLU-Liu18
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 is 4.354 Å (propane).
*   Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is greater than the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 (4.354 Å), its adsorption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided experimental data.

MOF Name: JLU-Liu18
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 is 4.354 Å (propane).
*   cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is greater than the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 (4.354 Å), its adsorption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided experimental data.

MOF Name: JLU-Liu18
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 is 4.354 Å (propane).
*   1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is greater than the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 (4.354 Å), its adsorption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided experimental data.

MOF Name: JLU-Liu18
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 is 4.354 Å (propane).
*   trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since trans-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) is greater than the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 (4.354 Å), its adsorption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided experimental data.

MOF Name: JLU-Liu18
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
*   The largest intermediate dimension of a molecule known to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 is 4.354 Å (propane).
*   n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å.
*   Conclusion: Since n-pentane's intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is slightly greater than the largest intermediate dimension confirmed to be adsorbed by JLU-Liu18 (4.354 Å), its adsorption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided experimental data.
