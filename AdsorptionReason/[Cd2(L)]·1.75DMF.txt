MOF Name: [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF is at least 3.200 Å, as it successfully adsorbs carbon dioxide. No experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, meaning a precise upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be strictly inferred from a range. However, the material is described as exhibiting "Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale". In the absence of an explicit upper bound from non-adsorbed molecules, and considering the general behavior of MOFs with precise pore sizes, it is highly probable that molecules significantly larger than the largest adsorbed molecule will not be adsorbed due to size exclusion.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only known adsorbed molecule (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and given the MOF's "size exclusion" mechanism, it is predicted that isoprene cannot be adsorbed by [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF.

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data:
- Carbon dioxide: 5.198×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed

Inferred effective pore size of [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF is at least 3.200 Å, as it successfully adsorbs carbon dioxide. No experimental data is provided for molecules that were *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion, meaning a precise upper bound for the effective pore size cannot be strictly inferred from a range.

cis-2-pentene Dimensions:
- cis-2-pentene: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å

Conclusion:
Since cis-2-pentene's intermediate dimension (5.572 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only known adsorbed molecule (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and given the MOF's "size exclusion" mechanism, it is predicted that cis-2-pentene cannot be adsorbed by [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF.

1-pentene Dimensions:
- 1-pentene: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å

Conclusion:
Since 1-pentene's intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is significantly larger than the intermediate dimension of the only known adsorbed molecule (carbon dioxide, 3.200 Å), and given the MOF's "size exclusion" mechanism, it is predicted that 1-pentene cannot be adsorbed by [Cd2(L)]·1.75DMF.
