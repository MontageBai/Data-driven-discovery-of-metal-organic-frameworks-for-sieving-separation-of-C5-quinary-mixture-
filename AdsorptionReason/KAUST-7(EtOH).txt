MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for KAUST-7(EtOH):
- Propylene: 6.257×5.051×3.961 → Intermediate = 5.051 Å | Adsorbed: Yes
- Propane: 6.552×4.354×3.970 → Intermediate = 4.354 Å | Adsorbed: No (due to Size exclusion at sub-nanometer scale)

Analysis of experimental data and MOF's inferred effective pore size:
Based on the provided data and the rule for considering the intermediate dimension for pore passage, an inconsistency is observed. Propylene, with an intermediate dimension of 5.051 Å, is successfully adsorbed. However, propane, with a *smaller* intermediate dimension of 4.354 Å, is *not* adsorbed due to size exclusion. This directly contradicts a simple size exclusion mechanism based solely on the intermediate dimension as the determining factor for pore passage. This suggests that the MOF's pore selectivity for these molecules is likely influenced by more intricate factors such as molecular shape, flexibility, specific host-guest interactions, or orientation effects, which are typically associated with kinetic sieving or highly precise shape selectivity, rather than a straightforward intermediate dimension cutoff.

Therefore, a precise effective pore size range based purely on the intermediate dimension cannot be definitively inferred as a single value or simple range (e.g., [max_adsorbed, min_nonadsorbed)). Instead, we must consider the specific characteristics of the molecules that were adsorbed versus those that were excluded. The data indicates that KAUST-7(EtOH) can accommodate certain molecules with an intermediate dimension up to at least 5.051 Å (e.g., propylene), while excluding others, notably alkanes like propane (intermediate 4.354 Å), even if they have smaller intermediate dimensions. This implies a strong preference for alkenes over alkanes or specific shape-selective exclusion mechanisms for saturated hydrocarbons in this size range.

MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
Isoprene Dimensions: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å
Comparison:
Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) is adsorbed, while Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is not. Isoprene has an intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) that is significantly larger than both propylene (5.051 Å) and propane (4.354 Å). Given that a molecule of 5.051 Å represents the upper observed limit of adsorption, it is highly unlikely that a substantially larger molecule like isoprene would be able to pass through the pores of KAUST-7(EtOH).

MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)
Guest Molecule: cis-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
cis-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.067×5.572×5.136 → Intermediate = 5.572 Å
Comparison:
Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) is adsorbed, while Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is not. The intermediate dimension of cis-2-pentene (5.572 Å) is larger than that of propylene (5.051 Å), which is the largest molecule observed to be adsorbed. Despite being an alkene, its larger size suggests it would be sterically hindered and thus excluded by the MOF's pores.

MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)
Guest Molecule: 1-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
1-pentene Dimensions: 8.847×4.995×4.897 → Intermediate = 4.995 Å
Comparison:
Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) is adsorbed, while Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is not. 1-pentene is an alkene, similar in chemical nature to propylene. Its intermediate dimension (4.995 Å) is slightly smaller than that of propylene (5.051 Å), which was successfully adsorbed. Given this size comparison and the similar chemical class (alkene), it is plausible that 1-pentene can also be adsorbed by KAUST-7(EtOH), suggesting a shape-selective preference for alkenes in this size range.

MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)
Guest Molecule: trans-2-pentene

Predicted Result: Can Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
trans-2-pentene Dimensions: 8.796×4.733×4.564 → Intermediate = 4.733 Å
Comparison:
Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) is adsorbed, while Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is not. Trans-2-pentene is an alkene, similar to propylene. Its intermediate dimension (4.733 Å) falls between that of propane (4.354 Å, not adsorbed) and propylene (5.051 Å, adsorbed). Given that propylene, a larger alkene, was adsorbed, and considering the observed exclusion of propane (an alkane), it is reasonable to predict that trans-2-pentene can also be adsorbed, likely due to its alkene nature allowing for compatible interactions or passage.

MOF Name: KAUST-7(EtOH)
Guest Molecule: n-pentane

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
n-pentane Dimensions: 9.118×4.364×3.969 → Intermediate = 4.364 Å
Comparison:
Propylene (intermediate 5.051 Å) is adsorbed, while Propane (intermediate 4.354 Å) is not. N-pentane is a linear alkane, chemically and structurally very similar to propane. Its intermediate dimension (4.364 Å) is almost identical to that of propane (4.354 Å), which was explicitly excluded due to size exclusion. Given this strong similarity in molecular type and critical dimension, it is highly probable that n-pentane will also be excluded by KAUST-7(EtOH) due to the same size-exclusion mechanism.
