MOF Name: [Zn(dcpy)(bpe)0.5]·3H2O (1)
Guest Molecule: isoprene

Predicted Result: Cannot Adsorb

Detailed Reasoning:
From experimental data for [Zn(dcpy)(bpe)0.5]·3H2O (1):
- Acetylene: 5.538×3.200×3.200 → Intermediate = 3.200 Å | Adsorbed
- Ethylene: 4.679×4.047×3.200 → Intermediate = 4.047 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)
- Methane: 3.877×3.849×3.918 → Intermediate = 3.877 Å | Not Adsorbed (Size exclusion)

Inferred effective pore size of [Zn(dcpy)(bpe)0.5]·3H2O (1):
The MOF adsorbs acetylene (intermediate dimension 3.200 Å) but excludes methane (intermediate dimension 3.877 Å) and ethylene (intermediate dimension 4.047 Å) due to size exclusion. This suggests that the effective pore size is greater than or equal to 3.200 Å but less than 3.877 Å.
Therefore, the inferred effective pore size range is **3.200 Å ≤ Pore Size < 3.877 Å**.

Isoprene Dimensions:
- Isoprene: 7.746×6.093×3.963 → Intermediate = 6.093 Å

Conclusion:
Since isoprene's intermediate dimension (6.093 Å) is significantly larger than the upper bound of the inferred effective pore size (3.877 Å), it cannot be adsorbed by [Zn(dcpy)(bpe)0.5]·3H2O (1).
